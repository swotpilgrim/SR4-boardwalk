# Chapter 24: Fourth of July Preparations

The week between moving out and the Fourth of July passed in a blur of adjustments and small victories.

Mrs. Chen's boarding house was everything Finn had promised—clean, quiet, and impersonal in a way that felt freeing after years of Mother's watchful eyes. My room was tiny but mine. The shared bathroom was awkward but manageable. The neighborhood was loud and unfamiliar, but I learned its rhythms: the cannery whistle at shift changes, the sound of different languages mixing on the street, the way people nodded to each other in passing even if they were strangers.

I'd been taught to fear this place. Instead, I found it was just life at a different economic level. People working hard, getting by, taking care of each other in small ways that mattered.

Finn lived in the building next door, just like he'd said. First floor, back corner, in a room even smaller than mine. He showed me one evening after work—a space barely big enough for a bed and a dresser, with engineering books stacked against every wall and blueprints tacked above his narrow desk.

"This is where the magic happens," he said with self-deprecating humor. "Where a high school dropout pretends he can teach himself advanced mathematics."

"You're not pretending. You're learning." I picked up one of his notebooks, filled with calculations and diagrams in careful handwriting. "This is incredible, Finn."

"It's just practice. Doesn't mean anything without school."

"It means you're not giving up. That means something."

We'd settled into a routine. Work during the day, shared dinners when we could both afford it—usually rice and beans cooked on his hot plate. Evenings studying together, Finn working through engineering problems while I read library books about everything I'd never been allowed to explore.

I'd picked up extra hours at a bookstore near the arcade. The pay was minimal, but it meant I wasn't eating through my savings quite so fast. And being surrounded by books felt like breathing after being underwater.

Mother and I hadn't spoken since I moved out. I'd left a note with my new address in case of emergency, but she hadn't acknowledged it. The silence hurt more than I wanted to admit.

Ruby came by the boarding house midweek, carrying a care package from her mother—homemade cookies, a warm sweater, a note saying "We're proud of you."

"Mom wanted you to know not everyone thinks you're crazy," Ruby explained, sitting on my narrow bed since there was nowhere else to sit. "And I wanted to make sure you're okay."

"I'm okay. Scared, but okay."

"That's allowed. You're doing something incredibly brave." She looked around the tiny room. "It's smaller than I imagined."

"It's bigger than it looks. And it's mine."

"Have you talked to your mother?"

"No. She made it clear I was making my choice. This is me living with that choice."

Ruby squeezed my hand. "For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. Terrifying, but amazing."

The days built toward the Fourth of July like a wave building toward shore. The boardwalk prepared for its biggest celebration of the summer—extra decorations, extended hours, fireworks scheduled for nightfall. Walt asked all his employees to work extra shifts, promising bonus pay.

I said yes immediately. Bonus pay meant I could maybe afford a new pair of shoes to replace the ones falling apart. Could maybe splurge on fresh vegetables instead of just rice and canned beans.

Thursday evening, Finn found me at the arcade near closing.

"Want to see the fireworks setup?" he asked. "They're testing the launch points tonight."

We walked out to the pier together, where workers were positioning mortars and running through safety checks. The ocean stretched dark and endless, and above us, the first stars were appearing.

"When I was a kid," Finn said, leaning against the railing, "I used to sneak down here for the Fourth of July fireworks. My family couldn't afford the boardwalk celebration, but you could see the show from the beach if you found the right spot."

"Did you come alone?"

"Usually. Sometimes with my brother Danny, but he was too young to stay awake most years." Finn smiled at the memory. "I'd sit in the dark and watch the sky explode with color, and I'd think about chemical reactions and combustion patterns and how you could make beauty out of controlled explosions. Even then, I was thinking like an engineer."

"You've always known what you wanted."

"Known what I wanted, yeah. Just never thought I'd actually get it." He looked at me. "Until recently."

"What changed?"

"You. Watching you be brave enough to choose yourself made me think maybe I could choose myself too. Maybe wanting things wasn't stupid just because they seemed impossible."

I leaned against him, comfortable in a way I'd never been with Martin. "So what do you want? Really want?"

"Night school. Engineering degree. Eventually, my own firm—small, maybe just me and a few people, but doing real work. Designing structures that matter." He paused. "And you. If you'll have me once you figure out you could do better."

"I couldn't do better. And I don't want to." I turned to face him. "But I need you to understand something. I'm not doing this—living in a boarding house, working two jobs, barely scraping by—I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for me."

"I know."

"And if things between us don't work out, I'm still not going back. This is my path now, whether you're on it or not."

"I know that too." He pulled me closer. "That's part of why I lo—" He stopped himself. "Why this works. Because you're not sacrificing for me. You're choosing for you. And I just happen to benefit from that choice."

"Were you about to say 'love'?"

"Maybe. Too soon?"

"Probably. But say it anyway."

"I love you, Caroline Webb. Even though it's too soon and probably stupid and definitely not what anyone would advise."

"I love you too, Finn Callahan. Even though it's completely impractical and makes no financial sense and will probably be harder than either of us can imagine."

He kissed me then, soft and sweet and full of promise. Not our first kiss—we'd shared several in the past weeks, stolen moments between work shifts and evening studies. But this one felt different. More certain. Like we'd crossed some invisible line from possibility into reality.

When we broke apart, he rested his forehead against mine. "Fourth of July is in two days."

"I know."

"Big celebration. Fireworks. Crowds. The whole boardwalk will be packed."

"I'm working a double shift. Arcade during the day, then helping with crowd management for the fireworks."

"Me too. Checking all the rides, making sure the electrical holds up for the extra lighting." He smiled. "But maybe after? Once the fireworks are done and the crowds clear? We could find a quiet spot. Just us."

"I'd like that."

We stood on the pier while the workers finished their test, while the ocean rolled dark beneath us, while above us the stars multiplied in the deepening night.

Two days until the Fourth of July. Two days until the boardwalk's biggest celebration. Two days until fireworks and crowds and the kind of summer magic that made everything feel possible.

I'd been working at the arcade for nearly two months now. Had gone from nervous girl following her mother's plan to someone living in a boarding house and making her own way. Had gone from never questioning anything to questioning everything. Had gone from playing it safe to risking it all.

And standing here with Finn, with the ocean breeze carrying salt and possibility, with my tiny room three blocks away and my independence hard-won and fragile—I felt something I'd never felt in my mother's house with its certainty and safety.

I felt alive.

Friday morning, I worked the arcade. Friday afternoon, I worked the bookstore. Friday evening, I came home to my tiny room, made rice and beans on my shared hotplate in the communal kitchen, and fell asleep exhausted but content.

Saturday, I did it all again.

Sunday morning, I woke to Mrs. Chen's yelling—she'd discovered someone had left the bathroom a mess and was threatening to evict the culprit. I learned the rhythms of communal living: first to the bathroom got hot water, last one out cleaned the sink. Your food in the shared kitchen needed labels or it would disappear. Noise after eleven meant angry neighbors and Mrs. Chen's wrath.

It was nothing like the quiet, controlled order of Mother's house. It was messy and loud and required constant navigation.

I loved it.

Monday morning, I checked my money. Rent due Sunday—twelve dollars. Food for the week—five dollars if I was careful. Bookstore and arcade pay combined—thirty-two dollars for the week.

Fifteen dollars left over. Fifteen dollars for everything else—clothes, toiletries, emergencies, the future.

It was barely enough. Some weeks it wouldn't be enough.

But it was mine. Earned by me, managed by me, spent by my choice.

Tuesday afternoon, Ruby stopped by with news.

"Your mother came into the drugstore today."

My stomach dropped. "What did she say?"

"She asked how you were doing. If I'd seen you. If you were..." Ruby hesitated. "If you were okay."

"What did you tell her?"

"The truth. That you're working hard. Living in a boarding house. Managing." Ruby sat on my bed. "She looks awful, Caroline. Like she's not sleeping. She misses you."

"I miss her too."

"Maybe you should call her. Just to let her know you're alive."

"She knows where I live. If she wants to talk to me, she knows where to find me." But my voice shook. Because I did miss her. Missed her more than I wanted to admit.

Ruby left with promises to visit again soon, and I sat in my tiny room feeling the full weight of my choice.

This was what independence looked like. Not some romanticized version where everything worked out perfectly. But the messy, complicated reality of it. The financial stress. The loneliness. The missing people who loved you but couldn't support your choices.

And under all of that, a fierce pride that I was doing it. Actually doing it.

Making it work, day by day, choice by choice.

Friday morning—the Fourth of July—arrived with perfect summer weather. Clear skies, warm breeze, the promise of celebration hanging over Ocean Breeze like bunting.

The boardwalk transformed into carnival. Red, white, and blue everywhere. Vendors setting up food stalls. The band doing sound checks. Children already arriving with painted faces and flags.

I worked the arcade from opening until four, then switched to my evening assignment—helping direct foot traffic during the fireworks. It would be a long day. An exhausting day.

But Finn would be there. And after the fireworks, we'd have our quiet moment. Just us and the stars and the promise of possibility.

Tonight felt like a celebration of more than just Independence Day.

It felt like celebrating the choice to be free.
