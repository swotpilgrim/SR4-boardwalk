# Chapter 9: Questions Without Answers

"Okay, so tell me everything," Ruby said, sliding into the booth across from me at Morrison's Malt Shop. She'd dragged me here after my Saturday shift ended, insisting we needed "proper girl talk" that couldn't happen at the arcade.

The malt shop was busy with the evening crowd—teenagers clustered in booths, couples sharing milkshakes at the counter, the jukebox playing the Everly Brothers. The air smelled like french fries and cherry Coke.

"There's nothing to tell," I said, but my voice lacked conviction.

"Caroline Webb, I've watched you moon over that boy for two weeks now. Don't tell me there's nothing." Ruby ordered us both chocolate malteds from the waitress, then leaned forward. "How do you really feel about him?"

I stared at the table's red Formica surface. "I don't know."

"Yes, you do. You just don't want to say it."

"What's the point of saying it? Even if I did like him—which I'm not saying I do—it wouldn't matter. Mother would never approve."

"So what? Since when do you need your mother's approval to have feelings?"

"Since always?" I looked up at her. "Ruby, you don't understand. Your parents support whatever you want. When you got engaged to Tommy, they were thrilled. But Mother has everything planned, and Finn isn't part of that plan. He's not even close to what she wants for me."

"What about what you want?"

There was that question again. I was getting tired of not having an answer.

Our malteds arrived, tall glasses with whipped cream and cherries. Ruby took a long sip of hers, waiting.

"I don't know what I want," I admitted finally. "Honestly, I don't. I've been following Mother's plan for so long, I never stopped to think about what I actually want for myself."

"Then think about it now. Forget about secretarial school and Martin Fletcher and all of it. If you could have anything—anything at all—what would you want?"

I thought about it. Really thought about it, maybe for the first time.

"I'd want to feel like my life belongs to me," I said quietly. "Like I'm making choices instead of just following instructions. I'd want conversations that matter instead of polite social scripts. I'd want to spend time with people who see me—really see me—instead of just seeing what they expect me to be."

"That sounds like Finn."

"Maybe. I don't know." I stirred my malted with the straw. "But even if it is, what difference does it make? He's saving for engineering school. I'm supposedly saving for secretarial school. We're just two people working summer jobs."

"Two people who bring each other lemonade and ice cream. Two people who light up when they see each other." Ruby reached across the table and squeezed my hand. "Caroline, I've known you forever. You've never looked at anyone the way you look at him."

"How do I look at him?"

"Like he matters. Like what he says is important. Like you actually care what he thinks." Ruby pulled her hand back and took another sip. "With Martin Fletcher, you look polite and distant. Like you're performing being interested. But with Finn, you're actually interested. There's a difference."

There was a difference. I knew there was. Martin talked at me about insurance and advancement opportunities, and I nodded and made appropriate responses while my mind was somewhere else entirely. But when Finn talked about bridges or machinery or anything at all, I wanted to hear every word.

"Okay," I said. "Say you're right. Say I do have feelings for him. What am I supposed to do about it? Mother would lose her mind if she knew I was spending time with 'the maintenance boy.' And even if I didn't care about that—even if I was willing to stand up to her—what's the point? Summer ends in August. I'm supposed to start secretary school in September. Everything goes back to normal."

"Does it have to? What if you didn't go to secretarial school?"

The question hit me like cold water. "I have to go. That's the whole point of this job—saving up for tuition."

"But you just said you don't even want to be a secretary. So why are you saving up for something you don't want?"

"Because..." I struggled to find an answer that made sense. "Because that's the plan. Because Mother's counting on it. Because I don't have another option."

"You always have options, Caroline. You just have to be brave enough to choose them."

We finished our malteds and walked out into the summer evening. The sun was setting, painting the sky orange and pink. From here we could see the boardwalk in the distance, its lights starting to glow against the darkening sky.

"Just think about what you really want," Ruby said, hugging me goodbye. "And don't automatically say no to something just because it's not what other people planned for you."

Mother was already home when I arrived, working in the kitchen on Sunday's pot roast preparation. She looked up when I came in, her expression pleased.

"Good, you're home. Come sit with me in the dining room. I want to show you something."

My stomach sank. Nothing good ever started with "I want to show you something."

Mother spread fabric samples across the dining room table—different shades of blue and gray, various textures of wool and cotton.

"For your school clothes," she explained. "I thought we'd start with two skirts and three blouses. Mrs. Henderson's daughter is a wonderful seamstress—very reasonable rates. If we order the fabric this week, she can have everything ready by mid-August."

I stared at the fabrics. They were nice, actually. Good quality. Appropriate colors. Everything proper and sensible and exactly what a young woman attending secretarial school should wear.

They made me want to scream.

"These are lovely, Mother. Thank you."

"I'm so glad you think so." She touched a charcoal gray wool. "This one would be perfect for interviews after you graduate. Very professional, very serious."

"Mother... can I ask you something?"

"Of course, dear."

"How did you decide you wanted to be a bookkeeper? Was that something you always wanted to do?"

Mother looked surprised by the question. "Well, I didn't have much choice, dear. After your father died, I needed work. The law firm was hiring, and I was good with numbers. So that's what I did."

"But do you like it?"

"Like it?" She said it like the question didn't make sense. "It's respectable work that pays reasonably well. That's what matters."

"But what about enjoyment? What about doing something you actually want to do?"

Mother set down the fabric samples, her expression shifting to something more serious. "Caroline, I'm going to tell you something important, and I want you to really listen. Liking your work is a luxury most people can't afford. What matters is security. Stability. Being able to support yourself so you never have to depend on anyone else's charity." Her voice tightened. "When your father died, I learned very quickly that the world doesn't care what you enjoy. It only cares whether you can pay your rent and put food on the table."

"I understand that, but—"

"No, I don't think you do. You've never had to worry about where your next meal comes from. You've never been turned away from a shop because people know you can't pay. You've never felt the shame of accepting handouts just to survive." She picked up the fabrics again, smoothing them with careful hands. "That's why I'm doing this. So you never have to feel that way. So you'll always have skills that make you employable, always be able to support yourself."

"But what if there's another way? What if I could find work I actually enjoy and still be able to support myself?"

"Like what?" Mother's tone suggested she already knew this was foolishness. "What other work would you do?"

I opened my mouth and realized I didn't have an answer. I didn't want to be a secretary, but I also didn't know what I did want to be. I just knew I wanted to choose for myself instead of following someone else's map.

"I don't know yet. But maybe I could figure it out. Maybe—"

"This is about that boy, isn't it?" Mother's voice went sharp. "That maintenance worker from the boardwalk."

My heart stopped. "What?"

"Margaret Henderson mentioned she saw you talking to him. Said you seemed very friendly." The disapproval was clear in every word. "Caroline, please tell me you haven't been foolish enough to develop feelings for someone like that."

"He has a name. It's Finn. And he's not 'someone like that.' He's smart and kind and hardworking."

"He's a maintenance worker with no education and no prospects. That's reality, whether you like it or not." Mother gathered up the fabric samples. "I don't want you speaking to him anymore. Is that clear?"

"Mother, you can't—"

"I absolutely can. You're seventeen years old and you're my daughter, and I will not watch you throw away your future for some summer infatuation." Her voice trembled slightly. "I'm trying to protect you, Caroline. I know you don't see that now, but someday you will."

She left the dining room, taking the fabrics with her, leaving me sitting alone at the table.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say that Finn wasn't just some summer infatuation, that she didn't know anything about him, that she was being unfair. But what was the point? She'd made up her mind based on what he did for work and where he came from.

She'd never even met him.

That night I lay in bed staring at my ceiling, thinking about Ruby's question. What did I want?

I wanted to not feel trapped. I wanted to make my own choices. I wanted to talk to Finn without feeling guilty about it.

I wanted my mother to trust that I could figure out my own life.

But wanting things and having them were different, like Finn had said. And right now, it seemed like almost everything I wanted was something I couldn't have.

The worst part was, I was starting to realize that following Mother's plan wouldn't make me happy. But I also couldn't see a way out of it. She controlled my future—the money, the schooling, everything. Without her support, I had no options.

Which meant I had to choose: my mother's approval and a future I didn't want, or my own path and losing everything she'd built for me.

It shouldn't have been such an impossible choice.

But it was.
