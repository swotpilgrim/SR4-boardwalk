# Chapter 11: Martin Fletcher

Mother was waiting in the parking lot on Friday evening, but she wasn't alone.

A man stood beside our Bel Air—tall, maybe mid-twenties, wearing a navy suit despite the summer heat. His hair was neatly combed, his shoes polished to a shine. He held his hat in his hands and smiled when he saw me approaching.

My stomach sank.

"Caroline!" Mother's voice was bright with forced cheer. "What wonderful timing. This is Martin Fletcher—you remember, I told you about him. He was kind enough to offer to drive you home tonight so we could all get acquainted."

Martin extended his hand, his handshake firm and professional. "Miss Webb. It's a pleasure to finally meet you properly. Your mother speaks very highly of you."

"Hello, Mr. Fletcher." I shook his hand, trying to hide my dismay.

"Please, call me Martin." He gestured to a sensible sedan parked nearby—gray, conservative, immaculately clean. "Shall we? I thought we might take the scenic route home, if that's alright with you, Mrs. Webb?"

"That sounds lovely," Mother said. "Caroline, I'll see you at home. Don't be too long."

She drove away before I could protest, leaving me standing in the parking lot with Martin Fletcher and his perfect posture and expectant smile.

"Your chariot awaits," he said, opening the passenger door for me.

I climbed in, feeling trapped.

The interior smelled like leather and car wax. Everything was spotlessly clean—no crumbs, no papers, no signs that anyone actually used this car for living. It felt like sitting in a showroom.

Martin slid into the driver's seat and started the engine smoothly. "So, Caroline—may I call you Caroline?—your mother tells me you're working at the boardwalk arcade this summer. That must be quite an experience."

"It's interesting work. Different every day."

"I imagine so. All those tourists, all that chaos." He pulled out of the parking lot carefully, signaling well in advance, checking his mirrors twice. "Though I suppose it's good preparation for your secretarial studies. Learning to manage chaos, dealing with difficult people. Those are valuable business skills."

"I suppose so."

"Your mother mentioned you're planning to attend Miss Porter's Business College in the fall. Excellent choice. They have a sterling reputation. I actually hire secretaries for our office occasionally—Metropolitan Life Insurance, you know—and the Miss Porter's graduates are always top-notch. Very professional, very competent."

He drove precisely the speed limit, his hands at ten and two on the steering wheel. Every movement was measured, controlled, proper.

"I've been with Metropolitan Life for three years now," Martin continued. "Started right out of college. Business degree from Rutgers. The insurance field is very stable, very reliable. Of course, it's not glamorous, but it's solid. That's what matters in the long run—stability."

"Mm-hmm."

"Take actuarial tables, for example. Fascinating stuff, really. Most people don't realize how much mathematics goes into calculating life insurance premiums. We have to consider mortality rates, compound interest, policy surrender rates—it's quite complex. But when you understand the mathematics, it's rather elegant."

I nodded, watching the scenery pass by. We were indeed taking the scenic route—down Ocean Avenue instead of the direct route home. The street ran parallel to the beach, offering glimpses of the ocean between the houses.

"The advancement opportunities are excellent," Martin said. "I'm on track to make junior manager by next year. That comes with a fifteen percent salary increase plus a discretionary bonus structure. Of course, one must demonstrate reliability and consistent performance, but I've maintained perfect attendance and exceeded my sales quotas every quarter."

"That's impressive."

"Thank you. I believe in diligence. Hard work and proper planning—that's the path to success. Your mother clearly understands that, given how thoughtfully she's mapped out your future. Not many young women have such clear direction."

He said it like it was a compliment. Like having every decision made for me was something to be grateful for.

"Do you enjoy the work?" I asked. "The insurance, I mean. Not the advancement—the actual work itself."

Martin looked genuinely puzzled by the question. "It's a respectable career with excellent prospects. That's what matters."

"But do you enjoy it?"

"I suppose I've never really thought about it in those terms. It's work, Miss Webb—Caroline. One doesn't need to enjoy it. One simply needs to do it well and be compensated fairly."

I thought about Finn's face when he talked about bridges. About how his voice changed, how his whole demeanor shifted. About passion and purpose and dreams that might never happen but were worth dreaming anyway.

Martin talked about insurance the way someone might discuss household chores. Necessary. Important. Completely devoid of joy.

We drove in silence for a few minutes. Martin seemed comfortable with it, occasionally pointing out houses he found architecturally significant or commenting on property values in different neighborhoods.

"Your mother mentioned the Independence Day celebration is coming up," he said eventually. "The town puts on quite a nice concert and fireworks display. I thought perhaps you might allow me to escort you? It would give us a chance to get to know each other better."

The words were a question, but his tone suggested the answer was already decided.

"Martin, I appreciate the offer, but—"

"I understand if you already have plans with friends. Perhaps the boardwalk dance the following week? I hear Walt Morrison throws quite an event. Very respectable, very wholesome. The perfect summer outing."

"I don't know if—"

"I'll speak with your mother and we'll coordinate the details. No need to worry about any of it. I'm quite good at planning." He smiled at me, clearly pleased with himself. "Organization is key to a successful social calendar."

He turned onto my street, pulling up in front of my house with perfect precision, parking exactly parallel to the curb.

"Well, here we are. Safe and sound." He turned off the engine and looked at me earnestly. "Caroline, I want you to know that I think very highly of you. Your mother has spoken about you for weeks now, and I can see she wasn't exaggerating. You're exactly the kind of young woman I've been hoping to meet—sensible, proper, with good values and clear goals."

I felt like he was describing someone else. Some imaginary perfect girl who existed only in Mother's descriptions.

"Thank you," I managed.

"I hope we can spend more time together. I think we could have a very suitable future." He said it like he was discussing a business merger. Suitable. Appropriate. Sensible.

Not passionate. Not exciting. Not real.

"I should go in," I said. "My mother will be wondering."

"Of course. Let me get your door."

He came around and opened it with practiced courtesy, offering his hand to help me out. His palm was soft, uncalloused. The hands of someone who'd never had to fix anything broken, never had to work with tools, never had to build something from nothing.

Not like Finn's hands. Finn's hands that were rough and strong and gentle all at once.

"Goodnight, Caroline. I'll be in touch about the Fourth of July."

"Goodnight, Martin."

I walked to my front door, feeling his eyes on me until I went inside. Mother was waiting in the living room, her expression eager.

"Well? What did you think?"

"He seems very nice."

"Nice? Caroline, he's perfect! Educated, employed, clearly going places in his career. And so polite, so proper. You could do much worse."

"I know, Mother."

"He's taking you to the Independence Day concert, he mentioned? How lovely! We'll need to find you something appropriate to wear. Something that shows you're a serious young woman, not one of those silly girls who only care about fashion."

She kept talking, planning, organizing. Deciding what I should wear, how I should act, what I should say. Mapping out my future one date with Martin Fletcher at a time.

I excused myself and went to my room, closing the door and leaning against it.

Martin Fletcher was everything Mother wanted for me. Stable. Respectable. Safe. A man with a reliable job and sensible plans and absolutely no spark of passion or spontaneity or genuine feeling.

He looked at me and saw a suitable wife candidate.

Finn looked at me and saw Caroline.

Martin talked about advancement opportunities and actuarial tables.

Finn talked about bridges that could span impossible distances.

Martin's touch was polite and professional.

Finn's hand holding mine had felt like coming home.

I pulled out the note Finn had left me—"Thanks for the lemonade"—and read it again. Then I looked at the Miss Porter's brochure Mother kept placing back on my desk no matter how many times I put it away.

Two futures. Two completely different lives.

One was safe and approved and would make Mother happy.

One was uncertain and disapproved and made my heart race just thinking about it.

And I was increasingly certain I knew which one I wanted.

The problem was, wanting something and being brave enough to choose it were two different things. Martin represented security, Mother's approval, the comfortable life I'd always been told to want.

Finn represented risk, Mother's disappointment, an unknown future with no guarantees.

How was I supposed to choose between safety and authenticity? Between pleasing everyone else and being true to myself?

I lay in bed that night thinking about Martin's question about the dance. He'd escort me, properly and appropriately. We'd be seen together by everyone in town. Mother would be thrilled.

And Finn would be there too, probably working, watching me arrive with Martin Fletcher and his perfect suit and his perfect plans.

The thought made me feel sick.

But I didn't know how to stop it. Martin had already spoken to Mother. The date was essentially arranged. Saying no would mean explaining why, and I couldn't explain that without admitting I had feelings for someone Mother had explicitly forbidden me to see.

I was trapped in a life that was supposedly being built for my benefit. Trapped by love and obligation and the weight of expectations.

And I had no idea how to break free.
