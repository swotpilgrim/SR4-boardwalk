# Chapter 6: First Real Conversation

Tuesday afternoon brought the kind of quiet the arcade rarely saw. A handful of families scattered across the skee-ball lanes. Two teenagers halfheartedly playing pinball. The claw machine sitting silent and untouched in the corner. Even the ocean sounded peaceful through the open doors, waves rolling in gentle rhythm instead of the usual crash and roar.

I'd reorganized the prize shelves twice already, counted my till three times, and wiped down the counter until it gleamed. There was only so much busywork available when nobody needed tokens.

That's when Finn appeared with his toolbox, heading for the pinball machines lined against the back wall.

"Routine maintenance," he said when he caught me watching. Not quite a greeting, but not unfriendly either. We'd settled into something carefully polite since Saturday. Not friends, exactly, but no longer antagonists.

I watched him open the service panel on the first pinball machine and begin examining the mechanisms inside. His hands moved with that same practiced confidence I'd noticed before, checking connections, testing springs, cleaning contacts.

The idea came before I could talk myself out of it.

"Would you like a Coca-Cola?" I called across the arcade.

Finn looked up, surprised. "What?"

"A Coca-Cola. There's a cooler back here for employees. Walt said I could help myself when it's slow." I pulled open the small refrigerator tucked beneath the counter. "I'm having one anyway. Would you like one?"

He hesitated, like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of trick. Then he nodded. "Sure. Thanks."

I grabbed two bottles, used the opener mounted on the cooler's side, and carried one over to him. The glass was cold and slick with condensation, refreshing in the stuffy afternoon heat.

"Thanks," Finn said again, accepting the bottle. He took a drink, then returned his attention to the pinball machine.

I stood there awkwardly, holding my own Coca-Cola, not sure if I should go back to my counter or stay. The silence stretched between us, not quite comfortable but not hostile either.

"How long have you been doing this?" I asked finally. "Maintenance work, I mean."

"Three years. Since I was fifteen." He didn't look up from the machine.

"You started when you were fifteen?"

"Needed the work." He adjusted something inside the pinball mechanism, tested it, adjusted again. "Walt took a chance on me. Most people won't hire you that young, especially for skilled work. But he said he needed help and I needed money, so we figured it out."

"Do you like it?"

Finn shrugged. "It pays."

It was the same non-answer he'd given Walt on my first day. The kind of response that shut down conversation instead of opening it up. But something made me push a little further.

"But do you like it? The work itself, I mean. Not just the money."

This time he did look up, his expression curious. "Why do you want to know?"

"I don't know. I just..." I struggled to explain. "You're really good at it. I've watched you fix things, and you always seem to know exactly what's wrong and how to solve it. That seems like it would be satisfying. To fix things."

Finn studied me for a long moment, like he was trying to decide if I was serious or just making polite conversation. Finally, he set down his screwdriver and took another drink of Coca-Cola.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "I like it. I like figuring out how things work. Why they break. How to make them work again." He gestured at the pinball machine. "This one, for example. Most people would just say it's old, replace the whole thing. But if you look at it right, you can see it's just the flipper spring losing tension. Replace that one spring, and the whole machine works perfectly for another year. Five-cent part instead of a three-hundred-dollar machine."

"That's smart."

"That's practical." But there was something in his voice that suggested he was pleased I'd noticed. "Walt taught me that. Don't replace what you can repair. Don't throw away what you can fix. Most things are worth saving if you're willing to put in the work."

I thought about that while Finn returned to his maintenance. The idea that things were worth saving. That broken didn't mean worthless. That sometimes the solution was patience and attention instead of starting over from scratch.

"What about you?" Finn asked suddenly. "You like working here?"

"I—" I started to give my prepared answer about saving money for school, but something about the quiet afternoon and the Coca-Cola and the way Finn had actually answered my question made me pause. "I don't know yet. I like parts of it. Helping the kids choose prizes. Figuring out how to manage the rush without panicking. Learning how everything works."

"But not all of it."

"Some of the customers are difficult. And it's loud. And by the end of the day my feet hurt and I smell like machine oil." I smiled a little. "But I guess that's just part of working."

"What are you saving for?" Finn closed the pinball machine's service panel and moved to the next one. "You mentioned secretarial school that first time we talked."

"Miss Porter's Business College. Six-month program." I recited it automatically, the way I'd been trained. "Typing, shorthand, filing systems, business correspondence. Everything you need for a respectable career."

Finn opened the second machine and began his examination. "Is that what you want to do? Secretary work?"

The question landed strangely, just like it had the last time he'd asked. Nobody ever asked what I wanted. They told me what made sense, what was practical, what was appropriate for a young woman. They told me about security and stability and making smart choices.

But Finn was asking what I wanted. As if my wanting mattered. As if it was even relevant to the decision.

"It's a good career," I said carefully. "Respectable. Stable. My mother says—"

"I didn't ask what your mother says." Finn's voice was gentle, not challenging. "I asked what you want."

I opened my mouth to answer and found I didn't know what to say. What did I want? I'd spent so long following The Plan, checking off boxes, working toward goals other people had set, that I'd never actually stopped to ask myself that question.

"I don't know," I admitted finally. The words felt dangerous. Disloyal somehow. "I mean, secretarial school makes sense. It's practical. And I'm good at organizing things, keeping track of details. So I'd probably be good at it."

"Being good at something isn't the same as wanting to do it."

"No," I agreed quietly. "It's not."

Finn worked in silence for a moment, testing the flipper mechanisms on the second machine. Then he said, "My dad was a fisherman. Good one too. Knew the water, knew the fish, could read weather better than any forecast. He wanted me to work the boats with him."

"But you didn't want to?"

"I get seasick." He said it matter-of-factly. "Boats make me sick. Always have. But he kept pushing because that's what Callahans do—we fish. Took him two years to accept that maybe I had different skills. That maybe being good with my hands meant fixing things on land instead of pulling nets at sea."

"Is that when you started working here?"

"Yeah. He was angry at first. Thought I was rejecting him, rejecting our family. But eventually he saw that I was just choosing a different path. Not a wrong one. Just different." Finn closed the second machine and picked up his toolbox. "Point is, sometimes the life people want for you isn't the life you're supposed to have."

The words hung in the air between us. Heavy with meaning. Permission and warning all at once.

"I should probably get back to my counter," I said, though nobody was waiting there.

"Yeah. And I've got the shooting gallery to check." But Finn didn't move immediately. He looked at me with those dark, serious eyes. "Thanks for the Coca-Cola."

"You're welcome."

"And Caroline?" He waited until I met his eyes. "It's okay not to know what you want yet. But it's not okay to pretend you want something you don't. That's how people end up living someone else's life."

Then he walked away, heading toward the shooting gallery with his toolbox, leaving me standing there with an empty Coca-Cola bottle and a head full of questions I'd been avoiding for months.

The rest of the afternoon passed quietly. A few more families trickled in. I sold tokens, distributed prizes, maintained my counter with practiced efficiency. But my mind kept drifting back to Finn's question.

What did I want?

Not what Mother wanted. Not what The Plan dictated. Not what was practical or respectable or appropriate.

What did I actually want?

I didn't have an answer. But for the first time, I was starting to realize that not having an answer might be answer enough. That maybe I'd been so busy following someone else's map that I'd never stopped to figure out where I actually wanted to go.

When Mother picked me up that evening, she asked her usual questions. How was work? Any problems? Was I being careful with the money? I gave my usual answers, and she seemed satisfied.

But driving home through Ocean Breeze, past the neat houses and perfect lawns and the church with its white steeple, I found myself looking at everything differently. Wondering which of these people were living lives they'd chosen and which were just following paths other people had mapped out for them.

Wondering which category I wanted to fall into.

That night, I took out the Miss Porter's brochure that Mother kept on my desk. I studied the photograph of the woman at the typewriter with her perfect smile and perfect posture and perfect contentment.

For the first time, instead of trying to see myself in that photograph, I tried to imagine actually being her. Sitting at that typewriter day after day. Typing other people's letters. Filing other people's paperwork. Living a practical, respectable, safe life that someone else had designed.

And I couldn't do it. I couldn't make myself want it.

Which meant Finn was right. I didn't know what I wanted yet.

But I was starting to figure out what I didn't want.

And maybe that was a start.
