# Chapter 3: The Maintenance Boy

By Monday morning of my second week, I'd started to feel almost competent. I knew how to make change without thinking. I could estimate skee-ball tickets at a glance. I'd learned to keep the popular prizes—paddle balls, kazoos, small stuffed animals—at the front where kids could see them.

I'd started to think I had this job figured out.

I was wrong.

The morning rush hit around ten-thirty. Families migrating from the beach, sandy and sunburned, looking for shade and entertainment. Within fifteen minutes, every skee-ball lane was occupied, the pinball machines dinging frantically, a line forming at my counter.

I was helping a little girl count her tickets when I heard it. A grinding sound, metal on metal, wrong and loud. Then a child's voice: "It's stuck! Mom, it's stuck!"

I looked up and saw the crowd gathering around the middle skee-ball lane. The wooden balls had jammed somehow in the return mechanism, creating a pileup that blocked the whole system. Three children stood at the lane, one crying, the other two arguing about whose fault it was.

And behind them, a line of customers. Waiting. Watching. Starting to look annoyed.

My stomach dropped.

"Just a moment," I told the family at my counter, and hurried over to the skee-ball lanes.

The jam was obvious—you could see where the balls had wedged together, stuck in the return channel. What wasn't obvious was how to fix it. I knelt down, reaching into the mechanism, trying to pull the balls free. They wouldn't budge. I pulled harder. Nothing.

"Excuse me, but are you going to fix this?" A woman in a floral sundress, holding the hand of a little girl. "We've been waiting to play."

"Yes, I'm working on it." I pulled at the balls again. Still stuck.

"Maybe you should get someone who knows what they're doing." This from a teenage boy in a letterman jacket, his arms crossed.

Heat flooded my face. "I'm handling it."

Except I wasn't. I had no idea what I was doing, and the line of customers was getting longer, and more people were noticing that something was wrong. I could feel them watching me, waiting, judging.

I needed help.

I scanned the arcade, looking for Walt, but he was nowhere in sight. Then I remembered—Finn. The maintenance worker. Walt had said Finn fixed everything.

I spotted him near the back of the arcade, doing something with the electrical panel. I waved, trying to catch his attention without actually leaving my post. He didn't see me.

"Excuse me," I called out, my voice coming out higher and more desperate than I intended. "Excuse me! I need help over here!"

Several customers turned to look. Finn straightened up from the electrical panel, saw me waving, and reached for his toolbox.

He took his time walking over. At least, it felt like he took his time. Probably it was thirty seconds, but with a dozen people watching and three children on the verge of tears, it felt like an hour.

"It's jammed," I said as soon as he was close enough. "The balls are stuck in the return. I tried to pull them out but they won't move. Can you fix it quickly? People are waiting."

Finn knelt beside the machine without a word. He set his toolbox down, opened it, and pulled out a flashlight. Then he just looked. Peering into the mechanism, moving the flashlight beam, his expression completely neutral.

"How long is this going to take?" I asked.

No response. He reached into his toolbox again, pulling out some kind of long tool—I didn't know what it was called—and began working it into the return channel.

The woman in the floral sundress sighed loudly. The teenage boy started talking to his friend about how "disorganized" this place was. More people joined the line, saw the jam, looked annoyed.

"Can you hurry?" I asked. "Please? Everyone's waiting."

Still nothing. Finn's hands moved steadily, precisely, completely focused on what he was doing. It was like I wasn't even there.

Five minutes passed. Then seven. Then ten. I stood there uselessly, watching him work, feeling every passing second like a small failure. Why was this taking so long? It was just some stuck balls. How complicated could it be?

"Maybe you should call your boss," the woman suggested. "This young man doesn't seem to know what he's doing either."

That's when something in me snapped. All the anxiety of trying to prove myself, all the pressure of The Plan, all the watching eyes and waiting customers—it compressed into a tight knot of frustration, and I turned on the one person I could.

"Are you almost done?" I asked Finn, my voice sharp. "Because this is taking forever, and I have customers who want to use this machine, and I don't understand why it's so complicated to just pull out some wooden balls—"

Finn looked up. His eyes met mine, and for a second I saw something flash there. Not anger, exactly. Something colder than that. Something that made me feel suddenly, acutely small.

"You want to try?" He held out the tool, his voice flat. "Go ahead. Fix it yourself, princess."

Princess. The word landed like a slap.

I felt my face go hot. "I didn't mean—"

"Yeah." He turned back to the machine. "You did."

For the next three minutes, I stood there in burning silence while Finn worked. He didn't say another word. Just kept his hands moving, his expression locked down tight, until finally—finally—there was a click, and the balls came rolling free down the return channel.

The children cheered. The woman in the sundress immediately claimed the lane for her daughter. The teenage boy rolled his eyes and moved to a different lane. Everything returned to normal, the crisis averted, as if nothing had happened.

Finn packed up his tools, closed his toolbox, and stood. He still didn't look at me.

"Thank you," I managed, but it came out wrong. Too late, too small.

He walked away without responding. Just picked up his toolbox and left. Like I was nothing.

Which, I realized with an uncomfortable twist in my stomach, was exactly how I'd made him feel.

I went back to my counter. Sold more tokens. Distributed more prizes. Answered more questions. The rest of the morning passed normally, but I couldn't shake the feeling of Finn's eyes meeting mine, that flash of something cold and distant, and the word that kept echoing in my head.

Princess.

Like I was some spoiled girl who'd never done anything difficult in her life. Who snapped her fingers and expected everyone to rush to fix her problems. Who looked down on people who actually knew how to do things, who worked with their hands, who took the time to do the job right instead of just fast.

The worst part was, I couldn't even argue with it. That's exactly how I'd acted. I'd stood there criticizing him for taking too long, as if I had any idea what he was doing, as if I could have done better. I'd treated him like he was some kind of servant who was failing to perform quickly enough for my liking.

I'd been rude. More than rude. I'd been dismissive. The same way that woman at the bench had been dismissive last week, complaining that he was in her way. The same way the tourists walked past him like he was part of the scenery, not worth noticing unless they needed something.

I'd become exactly the kind of person I didn't want to be.

The thought sat in my stomach like a stone for the rest of the day. I watched for Finn, caught glimpses of him working in different parts of the arcade, but he didn't come near my counter again. When the closing bell rang at eight o'clock, I saw him leave through the back door, toolbox in hand, without so much as a glance in my direction.

"Everything alright?" Walt asked as I was counting my drawer.

"Yes. Fine." I couldn't quite meet his eyes.

"That skee-ball jam was a tricky one. Three-ball pileup in a narrow channel—Finn had to disassemble half the return mechanism to clear it. Did a good job, though. Always does."

"Oh." My voice came out small. "I didn't realize it was that complicated."

Walt gave me a long look. "Most things are more complicated than they seem, Caroline. That's something worth remembering."

He said it kindly, but I heard the lesson underneath. I nodded, finished counting my drawer—perfect again, not that it mattered—and gathered my things.

Mother was waiting in the parking lot, punctual as always.

"How was your day, dear?"

"Fine," I said automatically. Then, because I couldn't quite hold it in, "I made a mistake, though."

"With the cash drawer?" Mother's voice sharpened with concern.

"No. With a person."

I didn't elaborate, and Mother didn't press. We drove home through the evening streets, past the neat houses and the perfect lawns and the church with its white steeple, and I thought about all the things I'd been taught. How to set a table. How to speak politely to adults. How to dress appropriately. How to follow The Plan.

But nobody had taught me how to see people who were different from me. Nobody had taught me that the quiet maintenance worker with the toolbox might actually be doing something complicated and important. Nobody had taught me that "respectable" didn't mean the same thing as "worthwhile."

Or maybe they had taught me something. Maybe they'd taught me that people like Finn Callahan—people from the north end, people who worked with their hands, people who didn't wear Sunday suits to church—weren't the kind of people I needed to think about.

Maybe that was exactly what I'd been taught, and I'd learned it so well I hadn't even noticed.

That night, lying in bed with Miss Porter's brochure still propped against my lamp, I thought about Finn's hands working steadily at the jammed machine. The patience it must have taken. The skill. The knowledge of how all those mechanical parts fit together, how to take them apart and put them back together again.

I thought about him kneeling on the arcade floor, completely focused, while I stood over him complaining that he wasn't working fast enough.

Princess.

I wanted to argue with it. To defend myself. To explain that I'd only been stressed, worried about doing my job.

But the truth was simpler than that.

I'd been rude because I'd thought I could be. Because he was just the maintenance boy, and I was the girl behind the counter.

I'd been wrong.

And tomorrow, I'd have to face him again.
