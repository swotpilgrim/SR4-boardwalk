# Chapter 20: The Ultimatum

Mother drove me to work Thursday morning in complete silence.

Not the comfortable silence of two people who don't need words. The brittle, fragile silence of two people afraid that speaking will shatter what's left.

She'd barely looked at me since yesterday's confrontation. Had made dinner in cold efficiency, cleaning the kitchen without asking if I wanted to help, retreating to her room early. This morning she'd appeared at breakfast already dressed, her face carefully blank.

"Get your things," was all she said. "I'm driving you to work."

Now we sat in her Bel Air, driving the familiar route to the boardwalk, and I could feel her preparing herself. Could sense the words building up behind her pressed-thin lips.

She pulled into the parking lot but didn't stop at the usual drop-off point. Instead, she parked, turned off the engine, and turned to face me.

"I want to be very clear about what's at stake," she said, her voice carefully controlled. "So there's no confusion. So you can't say later that you didn't understand."

My stomach clenched.

"If you continue seeing Finn Callahan—if you refuse to end this foolishness—I will withdraw all financial support for your education. The secretarial school fund. The college money your father left. All of it."

"Mother—"

"I'm not finished." Her hands gripped the steering wheel. "You will apologize to Martin Fletcher. You will attend the boardwalk dance with him. You will conduct yourself properly."

"And if I don't?"

"Then you'll need to find somewhere else to live. I will not house someone who refuses to listen to reason." She finally looked at me, and I saw tears threatening. "I don't want to do this, Caroline. But you're forcing my hand. You're making me choose between enabling your self-destruction and being a responsible parent."

"This isn't self-destruction—"

"It absolutely is! You're throwing away your education, your reputation, your entire future for a summer infatuation with a boy who can't offer you anything!" Her voice cracked. "Do you think love is enough? Do you think you can live on feelings and good intentions? Because I'm telling you—I've lived it—it's not enough. When the romance fades and reality sets in, you'll be left with nothing."

"Finn isn't Dad," I said quietly.

Mother flinched like I'd hit her. "Don't. Don't you dare bring your father into this."

"But that's what this is really about, isn't it? You're terrified I'll end up like you did—widowed and struggling and dependent on charity. So you've spent seventeen years trying to protect me from every possible risk."

"Is that so wrong? To want better for my child?"

"No. But smothering isn't protecting. And your fear doesn't give you the right to control my entire life."

We sat in awful silence. Outside, the boardwalk was coming to life—vendors setting up, tourists arriving, Walt unlocking the arcade.

Nothing about today was normal.

"I'm giving you one more chance," Mother said finally. "End this thing with that boy. Apologize to Martin. Get your head straight. Or face the consequences."

"What if the consequences are worth it?"

"They won't be. Trust me. When you're working two jobs trying to make rent, when you're eating beans for dinner because that's all you can afford, when you're watching your friends go off to college while you're stuck in some dead-end job—you'll realize how foolish you've been."

"Or maybe I'll realize I was brave enough to choose my own path."

Mother's jaw tightened. "You have until Sunday to make your decision. That's three days. Think very carefully about what you're choosing."

I got out of the car without responding. Watched her drive away, her back rigid, her pain visible even from behind.

The arcade was still closed. I sat on the bench outside, trying to process what had just happened, trying to calm my racing heart.

"You're here early."

I looked up. Finn stood there with his toolbox, concern written across his face.

"My mother drove me." My voice came out flat. "We needed to talk."

"About us?"

"About her ultimatum. Stop seeing you or lose everything." I tried to smile, but it felt wobbly. "She's giving me until Sunday to choose."

Finn set down his toolbox and sat beside me. For a moment, he didn't speak. Just sat there, solid and real, while my world spun apart.

"You should choose the money," he said finally.

I stared at him. "What?"

"Your education fund. Your college money. Your future. You should choose that." He looked at me, his expression serious. "Caroline, I can't give you any of those things. I can barely afford to feed myself. And I can't—I won't—be the reason you lose everything."

"You're not the reason. My mother's fear is the reason."

"Same result either way." He rubbed his face. "This is exactly what I was afraid would happen. You'd sacrifice everything for something that might not even last past summer."

"So what, you want to end this? Make it easy for me to choose?"

"I want you to have options. To not throw away your future for—" He gestured helplessly between us. "For whatever this is."

"This is real. This is the first real thing I've ever had."

"Real doesn't pay rent. Real doesn't put you through school." His voice was gentle but firm. "I know you think you're choosing bravely, choosing authentically. But I've lived without money, Caroline. I've watched my family struggle. And I'm telling you—it's not romantic. It's exhausting and scary and soul-crushing."

"So I should just give up? Go back to Martin and my mother's plan and pretend none of this happened?"

"I don't know. Maybe?" He looked miserable. "All I know is I can't be the reason you lose your education. I can't live with that."

We sat in silence while I tried to understand what he was saying. Finn, who'd admitted he was falling for me. Finn, who'd kissed my hand and held me close. Was trying to push me away for my own good.

Trying to protect me the same way Mother was trying to protect me.

And I was tired—so tired—of everyone else deciding what was best for me.

"You don't get to make this decision for me," I said. "Neither does my mother. This is my choice. My life. My future to risk."

"But—"

"No." I turned to face him fully. "Listen to me. I appreciate that you're trying to be noble. That you care about my future. But you don't get to decide I should choose the safe path because you think I can't handle the hard one."

"I'm just trying to—"

"Protect me. I know. Everyone's trying to protect me." My voice rose. "But what if I don't need protection? What if I need the chance to be brave and foolish and make my own mistakes?"

Finn looked at me for a long moment. "And if you regret it? If you end up resenting me?"

"Then that's my problem. My regret. My resentment to deal with." I grabbed his hand. "But I won't regret choosing honestly. And I won't resent you for being yourself."

"Your mother might never forgive you."

"I know."

"You might lose everything—school, home, family support."

"I know that too."

"And you're still willing to risk it?"

"For the chance to figure out who I am when I'm not following someone else's script? Yes. Absolutely yes."

Finn studied our joined hands, his thumb tracing circles on my palm—that gesture that had become familiar, comforting.

"You're braver than anyone I've ever met," he said quietly. "Or crazier. I haven't decided which."

"Can't it be both?"

"Probably is." He looked up, meeting my eyes. "But Caroline, if you do this—if you really choose to walk away from everything your mother's offering—you need to understand something. I can't save you. I can't swoop in and make everything okay. I'm drowning myself most days."

"I'm not asking you to save me. I'm asking you to let me save myself."

"And how do you plan to do that?"

"I don't know yet. Find another job. A cheaper room to rent. Figure out scholarships or loans or work-study programs." My voice shook but stayed determined. "I'll find a way. People do it every day. You do it every day."

"It's harder than you think."

"Then I'll learn." I squeezed his hand. "But I need to know—is this just about the money? Or are you trying to push me away because you're scared?"

Finn was quiet for so long I thought he wouldn't answer. Then: "Both. Maybe. I'm terrified of being the reason you lose everything. But I'm also terrified of letting myself have this, have you, and then losing it anyway."

"What if we could have it? What if it worked?"

"And what if it doesn't?"

"Then at least we tried. At least we chose something real instead of something safe." I pulled his hand to my chest, letting him feel my racing heart. "I'm scared too, Finn. I'm absolutely terrified. But I'm more terrified of waking up in twenty years and realizing I spent my whole life living someone else's safe, approved dream."

Finn's expression softened. "You really mean it. All of it."

"Every word."

He pulled me close, his arms around me, his face buried in my hair. "Okay," he whispered. "Okay. But when this gets hard—and it will get hard—you have to promise me you won't regret it. You won't blame me."

"I promise."

"And you'll tell me if you change your mind. If you decide the cost is too high."

"I won't change my mind."

"But if you do—"

"I'll tell you." I pulled back to look at him. "But Finn? You have to promise me something too."

"What?"

"Stop trying to push me away for my own good. Stop deciding what I can or can't handle. If we're doing this—if we're trying—then we have to trust each other to know our own minds."

He nodded slowly. "Okay. I can do that."

"Good. Because I have three days to figure out how to survive without my mother's support. And I could use a friend who believes I can do it."

"You can do it. You're tougher than you look." He kissed my forehead gently. "But it's going to be brutal."

"I know."

"Your mother's going to fight you every step."

"I know that too."

"And you're still choosing this."

"I'm choosing me. You just happen to be part of that choice."

Walt appeared at the arcade door, keys jangling. "You two planning to work today? Or just sit out here holding hands?"

We broke apart, embarrassed. But Finn kept hold of my hand as we walked to the arcade.

Three days. Seventy-two hours to figure out how to support myself, find somewhere to live, plan a future without the safety net I'd always taken for granted.

It should have been impossible.

But with Finn's hand in mine, and my own certainty burning bright, it felt like maybe—just maybe—I could do it.

I had to.

Because going back wasn't an option anymore.
