# Chapter 26: His Fear

The fireworks continued overhead, but Finn pulled me away from the pier's edge, into a sheltered corner where the noise was slightly less overwhelming.

"We need to talk," he said, his expression troubled despite the celebration around us.

"That sounds ominous."

"Not ominous. Just honest." He took both my hands in his. "Caroline, I need to tell you something. Something I've been afraid to say because saying it out loud makes it too real."

My stomach tightened. "Okay."

"I'm terrified." The words came out in a rush. "I'm absolutely terrified that one day—maybe next week, maybe next year—you're going to wake up and realize what you gave up for this. For me. And you're going to regret it so much you'll hate me for letting you make that choice."

"Finn—"

"Let me finish. Please." His grip on my hands tightened. "You gave up your college fund. Your mother's house. Security. Safety. Everything most people spend their whole lives trying to build. And for what? To live in a tiny room in a building your mother thinks is beneath you. To eat rice and beans because that's all you can afford. To work two jobs just to scrape by."

"I made that choice. You didn't force me."

"I know. But that doesn't stop me from feeling responsible." He looked down at our joined hands. "I come from nothing, Caroline. I have nothing. My savings went to two college classes—two classes out of probably forty I'll need for a degree. At this rate, it'll take me ten years just to get an associate's degree. And even then, who's going to hire an engineer who learned from night school instead of a real university?"

"Someone who cares about skill instead of pedigree."

"Maybe. Or maybe I'll spend my whole life fixing arcade machines and dreaming about bridges I'll never design." His voice cracked slightly. "And if that happens—if I can't give you anything better than what you have right now—how long before you start wishing you'd chosen differently?"

I pulled one hand free and touched his face, making him look at me. "Finn Callahan, listen to me. I didn't choose you to get something. I chose you because being with you makes me feel like myself. Like I'm allowed to be honest and messy and uncertain instead of perfect and proper and predetermined."

"But what about later? When the romance wears off and you're just left with the struggle?"

"Then we struggle together." I moved closer. "Do you think I don't know what I gave up? I know exactly what I traded. And yes, sometimes I miss my mother so much it hurts. Sometimes I lie awake doing math that doesn't add up, worrying about rent. Sometimes I eat beans for dinner and remember pot roast at my mother's table."

"That's exactly what I'm afraid of—"

"But you know what I don't miss? I don't miss feeling like I'm wearing someone else's clothes. I don't miss conversations with Martin about actuarial tables. I don't miss watching my life happen to me instead of choosing it." I grabbed both his hands again. "Finn, you have to hear what I'm actually saying. I'm not sacrificing for you. I sacrificed the life my mother wanted so I could have the life I choose. You're part of that choice, but you're not the reason for it."

Finn was quiet, processing. Overhead, fireworks continued their pattern—burst, bloom, fade. Burst, bloom, fade. Celebration and ending, over and over.

"What if I fail?" he asked finally. "What if I can't make it through night school? What if I'm not actually smart enough to be an engineer?"

"Then you'll try something else. Or you'll try again. Or you'll find a different way to use what you know." I squeezed his hands. "But Finn, you have to stop catastrophizing. Stop imagining all the ways this could go wrong and let yourself believe it might go right."

"I don't know how to do that."

"I didn't either. But I'm learning." I smiled. "We can learn together."

He pulled me close, his arms tight around me, his face buried in my hair. We stood like that while fireworks painted the sky, while the crowd roared appreciation, while the world celebrated around us.

"I've been invisible my whole life," Finn said quietly against my hair. "People look through me, not at me. And then you came along and actually saw me. Listened when I talked. Cared about my dreams. And I keep thinking it's too good to be true. That I'll wake up and you'll be gone and I'll be invisible again."

"I'm not going anywhere."

"But what if—"

"Finn." I pulled back to look at him. "What if nothing. What if we stop imagining disasters and just be here, right now, in this moment? What if we let ourselves be happy without waiting for it to fall apart?"

"I don't know if I know how to do that."

"Then learn. Because I refuse to spend our relationship waiting for you to believe you deserve it." My voice was firm but gentle. "You do deserve it. You deserve to be seen and heard and cared about. You deserve dreams and opportunities and someone who thinks you're brilliant. And you need to start believing that."

Finn's eyes were wet. "You think I'm brilliant?"

"I think you're the smartest person I know. And I think if you'd had half the opportunities I've had, you'd already be designing bridges." I touched his face again. "But you didn't get those opportunities. So you're making your own. Taking night classes while working full time. Teaching yourself from library books. Refusing to give up even when everything is stacked against you. That's not just smart, Finn. That's extraordinary."

"You make me sound better than I am."

"I make you sound like you actually are. You're just not used to anyone noticing." I leaned my forehead against his. "So get used to it. Because I'm not going to stop seeing you. I'm not going to stop believing in you. And I'm not going to let you sabotage this because you're afraid of being happy."

"Is that what I'm doing?"

"Yes. You're catastrophizing and imagining worst-case scenarios and trying to protect yourself from disappointment by assuming I'll leave." I pulled back again. "But I'm not leaving. Not because things are hard. Not because you're taking ten years to get a degree. Not because we're eating rice and beans. I'm here because I choose to be here."

A particularly spectacular firework exploded overhead—gold and silver cascading like a waterfall. The crowd gasped, delighted.

Finn looked at me in the reflected light. "What if I told you I want to marry you someday? Not now—we're too young, too broke, too uncertain. But someday, when we've figured things out a little better. Would that scare you?"

My heart did something acrobatic. "No. Would it scare you if I said I want that too?"

"Terrifies me. But in a good way." He smiled, and it transformed his face from worried to hopeful. "A commitment to keep being terrified together?"

"The best kind of commitment."

He kissed me then—soft and sweet and full of promise. Not our first kiss, but it felt significant anyway. Like we'd crossed some invisible line from uncertainty into commitment. From maybe to definitely. From someday to eventually.

When we broke apart, another firework exploded, and another, building toward what felt like a grand finale.

"Thank you," Finn said.

"For what?"

"For not letting me talk myself out of this. For calling me on my catastrophizing. For seeing me clearly enough to know when I'm being my own worst enemy." He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "For choosing me even though I'm a disaster of insecurities and worst-case scenarios."

"You're not a disaster. You're just human. And I happen to like that about you."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Perfect people are boring. Give me someone real and messy and brave enough to try impossible things any day."

"Well, I'm definitely messy. And trying impossible things seems to be my specialty lately." He took my hand. "Come on. Let's watch the rest of the fireworks before they end."

We returned to our spot at the pier's edge, Finn's arms around me, watching the sky explode in patterns of light and color. The finale was building—more fireworks, faster, louder, more spectacular. The grand culmination everyone had been waiting for.

And I thought about Finn's fear. About how loving someone who'd been invisible his whole life meant constantly reminding him he was seen. That he mattered. That he deserved good things.

It wouldn't be easy. He'd have these moments of panic, these catastrophizing spirals, these times when he tried to push me away to protect us both from hurt.

But I could handle that. Because beneath his fear was someone worth fighting for. Someone brilliant and determined and capable of extraordinary things if he could just believe in himself half as much as I believed in him.

The fireworks reached their crescendo—the entire sky seemed to explode at once, colors overlapping, sounds thundering, beauty and chaos in perfect balance.

Finn held me tighter, and I leaned back against him, and we watched the impossible display together.

Just like we'd watch everything else together. The struggles. The victories. The moments of doubt and the moments of certainty.

Together. Learning to be brave enough to believe we deserved happiness.

Learning to stop catastrophizing and start living.

Learning that sometimes the most terrifying thing was letting yourself have what you wanted.

And choosing it anyway.
