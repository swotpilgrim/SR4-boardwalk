# Chapter 8: Small Kindnesses

The following Monday, I brought lemonade.

I'd made it that morning before Mother woke up, squeezing the lemons we kept in the icebox, adding sugar and cold water, pouring it into the thermos usually reserved for church picnics. I told myself it was just practical—the arcade got hot in the afternoons, and Finn worked outside in the sun, and it was just being considerate to share something cold with someone who'd been so helpful.

I didn't examine too closely why I'd gotten up early to make it from scratch instead of just bringing an extra Coca-Cola from the arcade cooler.

Around two o'clock, when the lunch rush had cleared and the afternoon lull set in, I spotted Finn replacing lightbulbs in the string lights that ran across the front of the arcade. I poured lemonade into the thermos cup and walked over.

"Thirsty?" I offered the cup.

Finn climbed down from his ladder, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked at the cup, then at me, surprised.

"You made this?"

"It's just lemonade."

"Nobody just makes lemonade." But he took the cup, drank deeply, and closed his eyes for a moment. "That's really good. Thank you."

"You're welcome."

He handed the cup back, our fingers brushing briefly in the exchange. "You didn't have to do that."

"I know. I wanted to."

Something shifted in his expression—that softening I was starting to recognize, the guard coming down just a little. "Well. Thank you."

It became routine after that. On hot afternoons when the arcade slowed down, I'd pour lemonade and find Finn wherever he was working. Sometimes he was nearby, fixing a machine or adjusting something in the arcade. Sometimes I had to walk the boardwalk to find him painting railings or repairing ride mechanisms.

But I always found him. And he always stopped working long enough to drink the lemonade and talk for a few minutes.

They were short conversations. Nothing earth-shattering. But they felt significant anyway.

Tuesday, while Finn fixed a wobbly leg on a bench, we talked about the weather—how different groups of tourists appeared based on whether it was sunny or cloudy. Finn had noticed that sunny days brought families with small children, while overcast days brought more teenagers and young couples. I'd never thought about it, but once he pointed it out, I could see he was right.

"You pay attention to everything," I said.

"Part of the job. You learn to read patterns. Helps you anticipate problems before they happen."

"Is that why you're always where you're needed right before something breaks?"

He smiled slightly. "Usually. Not always. Sometimes things surprise you."

Wednesday, I found him oiling the carousel's gears. The mechanical music had started sounding scratchy, and Finn was systematically working through each component, cleaning and lubricating. I sat on one of the painted horses—a white one with a blue saddle—and handed him the lemonade.

"How did you learn all this?" I asked. "The mechanical work, I mean. Did Walt teach you?"

"Some of it. But mostly I just figured it out. Took things apart, saw how they worked, learned to put them back together better." He took a drink. "Everything has logic to it. Once you understand the logic, you can fix almost anything."

"That's how you think about engineering too, isn't it? Finding the logic in how things work?"

"Yeah." He looked at me curiously. "You remember that conversation?"

"Of course I remember it. You talked about bridges like they were poetry."

Finn laughed—actually laughed, a real sound that made something warm bloom in my chest. "I don't think anyone's ever compared structural engineering to poetry before."

"Well, that's what it sounded like. The way you described it."

Thursday afternoon brought thunderstorms that drove everyone off the beach and into the boardwalk attractions. The arcade was packed with damp, restless tourists looking for something to do. By the time the rain stopped and people started trickling back outside, I was exhausted.

Finn appeared at my counter with two dripping ice cream cones from the stand next door.

"Thought you could use this," he said, handing me one. Vanilla, with chocolate sprinkles.

I stared at it. "You bought me ice cream?"

"You've been bringing me lemonade all week. Figured I should return the favor." He leaned against the counter. "That was a rough crowd. You handled it well."

"I felt like I was drowning."

"You didn't show it. That's what matters." He ate his ice cream—plain chocolate—and watched the last of the storm clouds rolling out over the ocean. "Weather's clearing. Probably get a sunset crowd soon."

We stood there eating ice cream and watching the sky clear, not talking, just existing in the same space comfortably. It felt natural. Easy. Like we'd been doing this for years instead of weeks.

Like we were friends.

Friday afternoon, Ruby stopped by the arcade. She worked at her father's drugstore most days, but she'd gotten off early and wanted to catch up. I was restocking the prize shelves when she arrived, and I didn't notice her at first.

I was too busy watching Finn demonstrate how the skee-ball machine worked for a little boy who kept rolling gutter balls. Finn crouched down to the child's height, showing him the proper way to hold the wooden ball, explaining about aim and follow-through in simple words the boy could understand. When the child finally landed a ball in the center ring, Finn high-fived him with genuine enthusiasm.

"He's good with kids," Ruby said beside me, making me jump.

"Ruby! I didn't hear you come in."

"I noticed." She smiled knowingly. "You were pretty focused on something else."

Heat flooded my face. "I was just watching him help that child. It's sweet, that's all."

"Mm-hmm." Ruby's smile widened. "Is that the famous maintenance boy?"

"His name is Finn."

"Finn." Ruby drew out the name like she was tasting it. "And you bring him lemonade?"

"How did you—"

"Caroline, you're carrying a thermos on a Friday afternoon in July. You hate lemonade. So clearly you're not drinking it yourself." She linked her arm through mine. "Spill. And I mean everything."

We retreated to the corner where I could still keep an eye on the counter but have some privacy. I told Ruby about the conversations, about Finn's engineering dreams, about how easy it had become to talk to him.

"And he's handsome," Ruby said, watching Finn work across the arcade. "In that quiet, serious way. Not flashy like the south-end boys, but definitely handsome."

"Ruby—"

"Caroline, you're blushing. You like him."

"We're friends. That's all."

"Friends who bring each other lemonade and ice cream. Friends who find excuses to talk every day. Friends who look at each other the way you two were looking at each other just now."

"We weren't looking at each other any particular way."

Ruby laughed. "You absolutely were. And it's wonderful! This is exactly what I've been saying—you need to follow your heart! You need romance and excitement and—"

"I need to save money for secretarial school and not complicate my life," I interrupted. But even as I said it, the words felt hollow.

Ruby's expression softened. "Do you really want to go to secretarial school?"

"It's a good plan."

"That's not what I asked."

Before I could answer, Finn walked past carrying his toolbox, heading toward the back exit. He caught my eye and nodded, a small smile playing at his lips. Not a big gesture. Just acknowledgment. Just connection.

My heart did something complicated.

"That's what I thought," Ruby said gently. "Oh, Caroline. You really like him."

"It doesn't matter if I like him. Mother would never approve. She's already trying to set me up with Martin Fletcher—"

"Martin Fletcher?" Ruby wrinkled her nose. "The insurance man who talks about actuarial tables? Caroline, no. He's duller than dishwater."

"He's respectable and stable and exactly what Mother wants for me."

"But is he what you want?"

There was that question again. What did I want? Everyone kept asking, and I kept not having an answer. Or maybe I had an answer and I was too afraid to admit it.

"I want—" I stopped, watching Finn through the arcade windows as he walked down the boardwalk, his toolbox swinging at his side. "I want to not feel trapped. I want to make my own choices. I want conversations that actually mean something instead of just polite social scripts."

"You want Finn," Ruby said softly.

"I barely know him."

"You know enough. I can see it in how you talk about him. How you light up when he's around. Caroline, I've known you since we were six years old, and I've never seen you look at anyone the way you look at him."

"It doesn't matter. Even if I—even if there was something—Mother would never allow it. He's from the north end, he doesn't have prospects, he's not the kind of person she'd ever approve of me seeing."

"So don't tell her. Or tell her and deal with the consequences. But don't give up something real just because it's not what she planned."

A family approached the counter wanting tokens, ending our conversation. Ruby hugged me goodbye, making me promise to have lunch with her next week. As she left, she called back, "Follow your heart, Caroline! Life's too short for actuarial tables!"

That evening, as I was closing up the arcade, I found a folded piece of paper tucked under the thermos I'd left on my counter. I unfolded it carefully.

"Thanks for the lemonade. And for listening about the bridges. Nobody ever wants to hear about that stuff. —F"

I read it three times, then folded it carefully and tucked it into my pocket.

Mother asked her usual questions on the drive home, and I gave my usual answers. But the whole time, I was thinking about that note. About how Finn had taken the time to write it and leave it where I'd find it. About "nobody ever wants to hear about that stuff"—as if his dreams were boring or worthless instead of fascinating.

That night, I took the note out of my pocket and put it in my desk drawer, next to the Miss Porter's brochure I'd hidden away. Two pieces of paper representing two completely different futures.

One I was supposed to want.

One I was starting to realize I did want.

And they couldn't be more different.
