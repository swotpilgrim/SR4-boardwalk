# Chapter 29: Fireworks

We found a spot near the pier where we could see both the sky and the water. Families surrounded us with sparklers and blankets. Ruby waved from across the crowd. Walt stood near his arcade looking pleased with the turnout.

The boardwalk had dimmed its lights so the fireworks would show better. Finn and I stood close together, not quite touching but aware of each other in that heightened way that made the air between us feel electric. My heart was still racing from our conversation on the Ferris wheel.

"Should start any minute," Finn said, looking up at the dark sky.

We waited. The crowd quieted, anticipation building.

Then the first rocket screamed into the sky, trailing sparks. It exploded in a cascade of red that spread like a flower blooming, petals of fire raining down slowly before disappearing.

The crowd erupted in cheers.

More followed. Gold bursts that crackled. Blue stars that scattered. Silver willows that wept light. Each explosion painted the sky, reflected in the dark water.

It was beautiful. Overwhelming in the best way.

But I kept thinking about what Finn had said on the Ferris wheel. About learning to hope. About how we'd both transformed this summer.

"Caroline."

I turned. Finn was looking at me instead of the fireworks, his expression serious.

"Come with me," he said again, holding out his hand.

"Where?"

"Trust me."

I took his hand and he led me through the crowd back toward the boardwalk. More fireworks exploded overhead—red and gold together. But Finn kept walking until we reached the Ferris wheel.

"Again?" I asked, smiling.

"One more time. For this." He gestured at the sky.

The operator grinned at us. "Back already? Must've liked the view."

"Best in Ocean Breeze," Finn said.

We climbed into a gondola. The bar came down. The wheel lurched into motion.

As we rose, more fireworks exploded. From this angle the display became something different. Not just above us but all around us. Colors reflecting in the water below, spreading across the sky above, painting the entire world in fire and light.

We reached the top just as the largest rocket yet screamed into the sky.

For a moment, nothing. Just the sound of it climbing, the whole crowd holding its breath.

Then it exploded—massive, spreading, a thousand points of light cascading outward in red and gold and silver all at once. The reflection painted the ocean, turned the boardwalk amber, lit up Finn's face beside me.

The crowd below erupted in applause and cheers. Somewhere a band started playing the national anthem. Another firework followed, then another, building to what must be the finale.

But I was looking at Finn.

He'd turned toward me, his expression open in a way I'd rarely seen. Vulnerable and certain all at once. His hand found mine on the bar between us, fingers threading through mine.

"I don't know what the future holds," he said, his voice barely audible over the fireworks. "I don't know if I'll finish night school or if you'll get to study literature or if any of the dreams we talked about will actually happen."

Another explosion overhead—blue this time, spreading like a wave.

"But I know one thing," Finn continued, his eyes steady on mine. "I know I want you in it. Whatever comes, however hard it gets, I want you there."

My throat tightened. "Finn—"

"I'm not proposing. We're too young, too broke, too uncertain about everything." His thumb traced circles on my palm. "But I am promising. I'm promising to keep choosing you, keep working toward a future worth having, keep believing we can do impossible things."

"I want you in mine too," I managed. "In my future, whatever it looks like. I want to build it with you."

Above us, three fireworks exploded simultaneously—red, white, and blue—the colors mixing and spreading.

And Finn leaned in.

I saw it happening—saw him moving closer, saw his eyes drop to my mouth, saw the question in his expression. This was a choice. One more choice in a summer of choosing.

I closed the distance between us.

His lips met mine gently. Carefully. Like he was afraid I'd disappear if he pushed too hard. His hand came up to cup my face, thumb brushing my cheekbone, and the kiss deepened.

I'd never felt anything like it.

Not the crush I'd thought I had on a boy in eighth grade. Not the awkward almost-kiss at a church social last year that I'd dodged. Nothing in my seventeen years had prepared me for this—the rightness of it, the truth of it, the way my entire body seemed to recognize this was exactly where I was supposed to be.

Finn kissed me like I mattered. Like I was precious and brave and extraordinary. Like he'd been waiting all summer for permission to do this and now that he had it, he wanted to memorize every detail.

Another firework exploded overhead, painting us in gold light. Then another in silver. The finale was starting—multiple rockets launching in sequence, the sky filling with color and light and thunder.

But I barely noticed.

I was kissing Finn Callahan at the top of a Ferris wheel while Ocean Breeze celebrated below us and the sky exploded above us and everything I'd ever wanted seemed possible.

His other hand found my waist, pulling me closer in the limited space of the gondola. I gripped his shirt, holding on, drowning in the sensation of this—his mouth on mine, his hands gentle but certain, the way he kissed me like he meant it.

Like this meant everything.

The fireworks continued. I could hear them—the whistle of rockets, the boom of explosions, the crackle of stars. Could see the colors even with my eyes closed, painting the darkness red and gold and blue.

But more than anything, I felt Finn. Real and solid and here. Choosing me the way I'd chosen him. Making promises without words—that he'd face whatever came, that he'd keep working toward impossible dreams, that he'd choose me over and over.

When we finally broke apart, both breathing hard, the finale was still going. Rocket after rocket, explosion after explosion, the sky so full of light it looked like daytime.

Finn rested his forehead against mine, his hand still cradling my face.

"Caroline," he said, just my name, but it sounded like a promise.

"I know," I whispered back.

Below us, the boardwalk was going wild. People cheering, children shrieking with delight, the band playing triumph. Above us, the finale reached its peak—what must have been a dozen rockets all launching together, filling the entire sky with color.

And between us, in this suspended moment at the top of the Ferris wheel, a promise sealed without words.

We'd face whatever came together. On our own terms. Building a life that was real instead of safe, honest instead of approved, ours instead of anyone else's.

The kiss had been gentle but certain. Sweet but meaningful. The physical expression of everything we'd been building toward all summer. The most honest thing I'd ever done.

The fireworks finally ended. The last explosion faded, its embers floating down like stars falling. The crowd's cheers slowly died down. The Ferris wheel began its descent, carrying us back to earth.

But I felt changed. Transformed. Like I'd left one version of myself at the bottom and was returning as someone new.

Someone brave enough to kiss the boy everyone said was wrong for her. Someone honest enough to choose authenticity over approval. Someone real enough to believe that impossible things might actually be possible.

Finn kept his arm around me as we descended. Neither of us spoke. We didn't need to. Everything important had already been said—with words on the way up, with the kiss at the top, with the promise between us that we'd keep choosing this, keep building toward a future worth having.

The gondola reached the bottom. The operator lifted the bar with a knowing grin. "Good ride?"

"The best," I said, and meant it.

Finn helped me out, his hand steady on mine. We stood on the boardwalk while the crowd dispersed around us, families gathering children, teenagers drifting toward the dance platform where the band had started playing again, vendors beginning their cleanup.

The celebration was winding down. But ours felt like it was just beginning.

"Thank you," Finn said quietly.

"For what?"

"For choosing this. For choosing me. For being brave enough to risk everything."

"Thank you for making it worth the risk."

He pulled me close, pressing a kiss to my forehead. Gentler than the one at the top of the wheel but no less meaningful. A promise that this wasn't just a moment, wasn't just fireworks and romance and summer magic.

This was real. This was us. This was the foundation we'd build on.

Tomorrow we'd go back to work. I'd return to my tiny room at Mrs. Chen's boarding house. Finn would return to his. We'd both keep saving money, working toward night school and education and the future we'd promised to build together.

It would be hard. Exhausting. Uncertain.

But tonight, standing in the aftermath of fireworks with Finn's arms around me and the taste of his kiss still on my lips, I believed we could do it. Believed we could do impossible things.

The kiss at the top had shown me what it felt like to be fully myself with someone who saw me clearly and chose me anyway. To be loved—not for who I was supposed to be, but for who I actually was.

That was worth everything. Worth every risk, every sacrifice, every difficult choice.

Standing there with Finn while Ocean Breeze celebrated Independence Day, I finally understood what that word really meant. Independence wasn't just about nations and freedom. It was about choosing yourself, being yourself, building a life that was yours instead of someone else's.

The fireworks were over. But their light still seemed to glow in the air around us, painting everything gold.

I was here. Finn was here. We were together.

And that was enough.

It was everything.
