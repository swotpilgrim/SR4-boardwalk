# Chapter 27: Promises Made

The fireworks finale ended in a cascade of gold that seemed to rain down from the sky. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Children on shoulders waved sparklers. The band started playing again, something triumphant and celebratory.

But Finn and I stayed at our quiet spot at the pier's end, letting the celebration wash around us without pulling us back into it.

"I need to tell you something else," Finn said once the noise died down slightly. "Something I've been thinking about for weeks."

I turned in his arms to face him. "Okay."

He looked nervous, his hands restless on my waist. "You know how I've been saving? The twenty-three dollars that went to tuition?"

"Yes."

"That wasn't all I was saving for." He took a breath. "I've been putting money aside for something else too. Something I never thought I'd actually need but couldn't stop myself from planning for anyway."

"What?"

"A future. A real one. Not just surviving day to day, but actually building something that lasts." He met my eyes. "I've been saving for an apartment. Nothing fancy—just a place where I wouldn't have to share a bathroom with six other people. Where I could have a desk big enough for my engineering books. Where I could maybe, eventually, have room for someone else."

My heart stuttered. "Finn..."

"I'm not proposing. We're way too young for that, and we can barely afford to feed ourselves, let alone think about marriage. But I want you to know—I'm not just trying to get through night school. I'm working toward something. A career. Stability. A life where I can actually offer you something instead of just struggle."

"I don't need you to offer me anything."

"I know you don't need it. But I want to be able to. I want to build something real. Not just for me—for us. If you want that too."

I thought about his words carefully. About what he was really asking.

"What does that look like?" I asked. "This future you're building toward?"

"Honestly? I don't know all the details yet. But I know the big pieces." He pulled me closer. "I finish night school. Get my engineering degree—however long that takes. Find work designing actual structures instead of just maintaining them. Save enough to rent an apartment, then maybe eventually buy something small. Build a life that's stable enough that I can actually take care of the people I love instead of just scraping by."

"That sounds like a long timeline."

"It is. Probably five years minimum. Maybe ten. I'm not asking you to wait around for some distant dream." He touched my face gently. "But I am asking if you want to build toward it with me. If you're willing to struggle through the hard years knowing there might be better years ahead."

"What if I have my own dreams? My own things I want to build?"

"Then we build them together. Or separately. Or side by side." Finn smiled. "Caroline, I don't want you to put your life on hold for mine. I want us to both chase what we want and support each other through it."

"What do I want to chase?"

"I don't know. Do you?"

It was the question I'd been avoiding for months. What did I want? Not what Mother wanted, not what made sense, not what was practical. What did I actually want for myself?

"I think..." I started slowly, finding the words as I spoke them. "I think I want to study literature. Real study, not just reading library books in my spare time. I want to understand how stories work, why some words matter more than others, how language shapes reality." I looked at him. "Is that stupid? When I could be learning something practical?"

"It's not stupid. It's you." Finn's eyes were warm. "And you should do it. Apply to community college. Take classes. Figure out where it leads."

"I can't afford tuition."

"Not yet. But maybe in a year? If you keep saving, if you pick up more hours at the bookstore, if we both work toward it?" He squeezed my hands. "We could do it together. Both be in school, both working, both exhausted but heading somewhere."

"That's a lot of struggle."

"Yeah. But it's struggle with purpose. Struggle that's building toward something instead of just surviving." He pulled me close again. "Look, I'm not promising it'll be easy. It'll probably be brutal. But I'm promising I'll be there through it. Supporting your dreams the same way you support mine. Building a life together instead of just existing beside each other."

I thought about what he was offering. Not romance and passion—though we had that. Not security and stability—we were years away from that. But partnership. Mutual support. Two people choosing to build their futures together, making space for each other's dreams even when resources were scarce.

"Okay," I said. "Yes. Let's do it. Let's build something together."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Literature classes for me, engineering for you. An apartment someday. A life that's ours instead of what anyone else planned. It'll take years and be hard and we'll probably want to quit sometimes. But let's do it anyway."

Finn kissed me then—deep and certain and full of commitment. Not a promise of marriage yet, but a promise of partnership. Of choosing each other not just for now but for the struggle ahead. For the long, hard work of building a life from nothing.

When we broke apart, the boardwalk was starting to empty. Families heading home, children asleep on parents' shoulders. The celebration winding down even as we were just beginning to plan ours.

"We should make actual promises," Finn said. "Not wedding vows—too soon for that. But promises about this. About what we're committing to."

"Okay. You first."

Finn took both my hands, his expression serious in the dim light. "I promise to work as hard as I can to build a future worth having. To not give up on night school even when it feels impossible. To support your dreams the same way you support mine. And to love you honestly—not perfectly, because I'm going to mess up sometimes, but honestly. To see you and hear you and choose you, even when it's hard."

My throat tightened. "My turn?"

"Your turn."

I took a breath, finding my own promises. "I promise to keep choosing authenticity over approval, even when it's painful. To build my own life instead of living someone else's. To support your dreams and chase mine. And to love you even when you're catastrophizing, even when you're doubting yourself, even when you're convinced you don't deserve good things. To remind you that you're seen and valued and extraordinary, until you believe it yourself."

"That's a big promise."

"I know. But I mean it."

"I know you do." Finn leaned his forehead against mine. "So we're really doing this? Building a life together even though we're broke and young and have no idea what we're doing?"

"We're really doing it."

"Okay then." He smiled. "Partners?"

"Partners. In struggle and dreams and figuring things out as we go."

"Best kind of partnership."

We stood there while the boardwalk emptied around us, while the band packed up, while the last families departed and the vendors began closing their stands. The celebration was ending, but ours felt like it was just beginning.

Eventually, Walt found us. "There you two are. Figured you'd disappeared somewhere romantic." He looked between us, his expression knowing. "Everything alright?"

"Everything's perfect," I said, and meant it.

"Good. Because I've got a proposition for you both." Walt leaned against the pier railing. "Caroline, how'd you like a raise? Five fifty a day instead of five dollars. You've proven yourself this summer, and I want to make sure you come back next year."

"Yes! Thank you!"

"And Finn, I'm promoting you to head maintenance. Seven dollars a day, plus you'll be training the other maintenance workers. More responsibility, but also more stability. You interested?"

Finn's eyes widened. "Are you serious?"

"Dead serious. You're the best worker I've got. About time I acknowledged that officially." Walt straightened up. "Think about it tonight, give me your answers tomorrow. But I hope you'll both say yes."

He walked away, leaving us staring at each other.

"Did that just happen?" Finn asked.

"I think so. You just got promoted. To head maintenance."

"Seven dollars a day. That's..." Finn did the math quickly. "Forty-two dollars a week. Almost double what I'm making now."

"And I got a raise. Thirty-three dollars a week after rent instead of twenty-three."

"That's..." Finn grabbed my hands. "Caroline, that's enough to save. Actually save. Not just survive, but save for tuition, for an apartment, for the future we just promised to build."

"It's really happening. We're actually going to do this."

"We're going to try. And with those raises, we actually have a chance."

I threw my arms around him, laughing with relief and joy and the sheer impossibility of it all working out. We'd made promises. Big, serious promises about building a life together. And now we had the means—barely, precariously, but real—to actually follow through.

"Thank you," I whispered against his chest.

"For what?"

"For seeing a future worth building toward. For believing we could do impossible things. For choosing me even though it was complicated and difficult and definitely not what anyone would advise."

"Thank you for choosing yourself. And letting me be part of that choice." Finn kissed the top of my head. "Come on. Let's go home. Tomorrow we can start planning how to use those raises. But tonight, let's just be happy we made it this far."

Home. Funny how that word had changed. It wasn't Mother's house anymore with its safety and rules. It wasn't even Mrs. Chen's boarding house exactly. Home was this—standing with Finn while the boardwalk shut down around us, making promises we'd spend years fulfilling, choosing each other over and over again.

Home was us. Building something together. Partners in the struggle.

And that was enough.

More than enough.

It was everything.
