# Chapter 17: Choosing Truth

Finn saw me coming.

I watched his expression shift from surprise to concern to something that might have been hope. He straightened up from the machinery, wiping his hands on a rag, his eyes never leaving mine.

"Caroline." He said my name like a question. "What are you doing?"

"I don't know," I admitted, stopping a few feet away. My hands were shaking. "I just—I couldn't sit in that car with Martin one more second. I couldn't listen to him talk about property values and statistical risks and act like any of that matters."

"Your mother's going to hear about this."

"I know."

"Martin's right over there. He's probably already noticed you didn't go to the restroom."

"I know that too."

Finn studied my face, his expression unreadable. "Then why are you here?"

"Because—" I stopped, trying to find words for something I'd only just recognized myself. "Because from up there, at the top of that wheel, everything looked so clear. I could see the whole town laid out below me, and I could see my whole life laid out ahead of me, and I realized..." My voice caught. "I realized I'd rather fall than keep riding safely in circles forever."

Something flickered in Finn's eyes. Not quite hope yet. Something more careful than that.

"Caroline, you need to think about what you're doing. If you walk away from Martin right now, publicly, at this celebration—everyone will know. Your mother will know. There won't be any taking it back."

"Good. Because I don't want to take it back." The words came out stronger than I expected. "I'm done pretending."

"Done pretending what?"

"That I want the life everyone's planned for me. That Martin is anything but exactly wrong. That I don't—" I stopped myself before I said too much. But Finn heard what I didn't say anyway.

"Caroline." His voice dropped low, almost gentle. "You can't make decisions like this on impulse. You need to be sure."

"I am sure. Maybe for the first time in my life, I'm actually sure about something."

We stood there while the celebration swirled around us. Music playing, children laughing, the Ferris wheel turning with its colorful cars catching sunlight. Everyone was having a perfect summer day.

Everyone except us, standing in this charged bubble of tension and possibility.

"Did you want to ride it?" I asked suddenly. "The Ferris wheel, I mean. Have you even gotten a break yet?"

Finn blinked, surprised by the question. "I'm working."

"Walt's right over there. He could watch the machinery for five minutes."

"Caroline, what are you asking?"

"I'm asking if you want to ride the Ferris wheel with me." My heart pounded. "I'm asking if you'll let me choose you instead of what I'm supposed to choose."

Finn's expression did something complicated. "You don't know what you're asking. If people see us together, if you're publicly choosing me over Martin—"

"Then they'll see. And they'll know. And I'm done caring what they think."

"You say that now—"

"Finn." I stepped closer. "Please. I rode that wheel with the wrong person, and it felt like dying. Let me ride it with the right person. Just once. Before I lose my nerve."

He looked at me for a long moment. Then, without a word, he turned and walked to where Walt was standing near the ticket booth.

I watched them have a brief conversation. Walt glanced my way, his expression knowing, and then he nodded. Said something to Finn that made Finn's shoulders tighten. Then Walt clapped him on the shoulder and waved us both toward the ride.

Finn came back to me. "Walt says he'll watch the machinery. We have one ride."

"One ride," I agreed, and it felt like we were agreeing to something much larger.

We walked to the line together. I was intensely aware of the stares, the whispers starting. A south-end girl in a yellow sundress walking beside the maintenance boy in work clothes. The very thing my mother had warned me never to do.

I didn't care.

Or maybe I cared desperately but was choosing to do it anyway. I wasn't sure which was braver.

The line moved faster than before. Soon we were climbing into a car together, the safety bar clicking into place. The operator—a teenager I didn't know—gave us a curious look but said nothing.

Then the wheel began to turn, and we were rising.

This time, there was no lecture about engineering principles. No discussion of property values or statistical risks. There was just silence, and the creak of the wheel, and the two of us sitting side by side as the boardwalk fell away beneath us.

"I can't believe you did that," Finn said finally. "Left Martin standing there."

"I can't believe I did it either." My hands were still shaking. "I've never done anything like that before."

"How does it feel?"

"Terrifying." I looked at him. "But right. Absolutely, completely right."

We rose higher, the car swinging gently. Below us, I could see Martin still standing where I'd left him, looking around with growing confusion. Could see Mother near the refreshment stand, chatting with Mrs. Henderson, oblivious. Could see Walt by the machinery, watching our car rise with what looked like approval.

"He's going to tell your mother," Finn said, following my gaze to Martin. "And your mother is going to lose her mind."

"I know."

"You could lose everything. The school money, her support, maybe even a place to live if she's angry enough."

"I know that too."

Finn turned to look at me, really look at me. "Then why are you doing this? Why throw away everything for—" He gestured between us. "For whatever this is?"

"Because 'whatever this is' feels more real than anything else in my life. Because when I talk to you, I feel like I'm actually awake instead of sleepwalking through someone else's dream." I took a breath. "And because I'd rather have nothing and be honest than have everything and be a lie."

We reached the top of the wheel, and the car stopped for loading below. We sat suspended there, high above everything, the whole world spread out beneath us.

"What are you doing with me?" Finn asked quietly. "Really. I'm nobody, Caroline. I fix broken things for minimum wage. I barely finished two years of high school. I live in the part of town your mother won't even drive through. What future do you think we have?"

"I don't know. But I know the future everyone else planned for me feels like wearing someone else's clothes. And this—sitting here with you, choosing you—feels like I'm finally myself."

"Being yourself doesn't pay for secretarial school."

"Then maybe I don't go to secretarial school. Maybe I figure out something else. Something I actually want."

"And what do you want?"

"I want to stop pretending. I want to make my own choices. I want conversations with someone who actually listens." I looked at him. "I want this. You. Us. Whatever this could be."

Finn was quiet for a long moment, his dark eyes searching mine. "You understand you're choosing uncertainty over security? Risk over safety? You understand I can't give you any of the things Martin could?"

"I understand you're the only person who ever asks me what I want instead of telling me what I should want. And right now, that matters more than anything else."

The wheel started moving again, carrying us back down. Our moment of suspension was over. Soon we'd be back on the ground, back in the real world, back where choices had consequences.

"This is going to get complicated," Finn warned. "Your mother will fight you. People will judge. And I—" He stopped, looking down at his hands. "I care about you too much to want to be the reason you lose everything."

"You're not the reason. My mother's expectations are the reason. Society's rules are the reason. I'm the reason, for finally choosing to be honest." I touched his arm, making him look at me. "Unless you don't want this. Unless you're trying to let me down easy."

"Don't want this?" Finn almost laughed, but it came out more like a groan. "Caroline, I've been trying not to want this since the day you brought me lemonade and actually listened when I talked about bridges. I've been telling myself you're off-limits, out of my league, destined for someone better. But wanting you is like telling my lungs not to breathe."

My heart did something acrobatic. "Then stop trying not to want it. Want it. Want me. Let yourself have this."

"Even if it's difficult? Even if there's no guarantee?"

"Especially then. Because at least it's real."

We reached the bottom, and the operator released the safety bar. Finn climbed out first, then offered his hand to help me. His palm was rough, calloused, warm. The opposite of Martin's soft, professional handshake.

I took it, and I didn't let go.

We walked away from the Ferris wheel together, hand in hand, where anyone could see. Where everyone would see.

Where Martin was now frantically searching the crowd.

Where my mother had just noticed me missing and was looking around with growing alarm.

Where Ruby stood near the cotton candy stand with her hand over her mouth, her eyes wide.

I saw it all. Registered it all. And kept walking anyway, my hand in Finn's.

"Caroline!" Martin's voice called out behind us. "Caroline, where did you go?"

I didn't look back.

"Are you sure?" Finn asked quietly, his hand tightening on mine. "Last chance to pretend this didn't happen."

"I'm sure."

"Then hold on," he said. "Because I think we're about to start falling."

"Good," I said. "I'm tired of being safe."

And for the first time in my life, I meant it.
