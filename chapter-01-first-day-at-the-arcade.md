# Chapter 1: First Day at the Arcade

The arcade smelled like salt air, machine oil, and something sweet I couldn't quite place—maybe cotton candy from the stand next door, or the prize candies stacked behind the counter. I stood in the doorway that first Monday morning, my hands clutching my pocketbook a little too tightly, and tried to look like I knew what I was doing.

I didn't.

"You the Webb girl?" The man behind the prize counter had a voice like gravel and eyes that missed nothing. He was older, maybe sixty, with silver hair and rolled-up shirtsleeves that showed forearms tanned dark by years of summer sun.

"Yes, sir. Caroline Webb." I smoothed my skirt—a sensible blue one Mother had approved—and stepped forward. "Mr. Morrison?"

"Walt. Nobody calls me Mister around here." He gestured at the arcade spreading out behind him, a chaos of flashing lights and mechanical sounds. "Welcome to Ocean Breeze Arcade. You ever work with money before?"

"I'm very careful with money, sir. I mean, Walt."

His mouth twitched like he might smile. "Good. You'll need to be. Come on, I'll show you the ropes."

The next hour passed in a blur of instructions. The token machine—"Don't let it jam, and if it does, don't try to fix it yourself." The prize shelves—"Kids under eight get help reaching, teenagers try to steal, watch 'em." The cash register—"Count it twice, record it three times, lock it when you step away even if it's just for a minute."

My head spun trying to remember everything. Walt talked fast, moved faster, and expected me to keep up. Around us, the arcade was already coming to life even though it wasn't quite nine o'clock. A family with three small children claimed the skee-ball lanes. Two teenage boys in rolled jeans and white t-shirts circled the pinball machines. A little girl pressed her nose against the glass of the claw machine, pointing at a stuffed elephant.

"You got all that?" Walt asked.

"Yes, sir." I hoped I sounded more confident than I felt.

"Walt."

"Yes, Walt."

"Good." He pulled a ring of keys from his belt and unlocked the cash register, counting out my starting change. "You'll do fine. Just remember—the machines break, kids cry, tourists complain. None of it's personal. You keep your head, smile, and holler if something's beyond you."

"What about repairs?" I thought of the mass of machines, all of them looking equally mysterious and breakable. "If something actually breaks?"

"Finn handles all that." Walt pointed across the arcade, toward the far corner where the shooting gallery stood. "See him there? The kid working on that rifle mechanism? That's Finn Callahan. He does all our maintenance."

I followed his gesture and caught a glimpse of a young man kneeling beside the shooting gallery, a toolbox open at his side. Dark hair, work clothes, completely absorbed in whatever he was fixing. I barely registered him—my mind was too full of token denominations and prize inventory and the fear of making a mistake.

"Just find Finn if something breaks. He'll fix it." Walt patted the counter. "You're on the clock now. Good luck."

Then he was gone, disappearing through a back door marked "Office," and I was alone behind the counter with an arcade full of customers and no idea if I could actually do this.

The morning rush started around ten o'clock and didn't let up until past noon. I sold tokens until my fingers cramped from making change. I helped children choose prizes—"The paddle ball or the kazoo? They're both five tickets." I watched teenagers crowd around the pinball machines, whooping when someone hit a high score. I explained to an annoyed tourist that no, we couldn't give refunds for tokens his children had already used.

I made mistakes. I gave wrong change twice—caught it both times, thank goodness. I knocked over a display of prize yo-yos. I forgot to record a transaction and had to reconstruct it from memory. But nobody yelled at me, and by the time the lunch crowd thinned, I was starting to feel like maybe, possibly, I might actually survive this job.

I needed this job. Three hundred dollars for secretarial school tuition—that was my goal. That was my future, according to Mother, and I needed to prove I could earn it myself. Five dollars a day plus tips, if I worked six days a week all summer, I'd have enough by September. Maybe even a little extra for new school clothes.

The afternoon brought a different kind of customer—families with small children, tired from the beach, looking for shade and entertainment. I watched a little boy, maybe five years old, carry his skee-ball carefully to the lane. He was too short to reach properly. His first ball rolled backward, nearly hitting his feet. His second went wide, missing the rings entirely. His face crumpled, disappointment and frustration building toward tears.

"Hey there, buddy." The voice was quiet, but the little boy stopped mid-sob and turned. It was the maintenance worker—Finn. He'd appeared beside the skee-ball lane without me noticing. "That's a tricky one, isn't it? Want me to show you a secret?"

The little boy nodded, wiping his nose.

Finn knelt down, bringing himself to the child's level. "See, you're not trying to throw it. You're rolling it, real gentle-like. Here, try holding it like this." He demonstrated, his hands patient and sure. "And then just let it go, nice and easy. The ball knows where to go if you don't fight it."

The little boy tried again, his small face screwed up in concentration. The ball rolled straight and true, dropping into one of the middle rings. Twenty points lit up on the board.

"I did it!"

"You sure did." Finn straightened up, ruffling the boy's hair. "Keep practicing. You'll be a champion by the end of summer."

The boy's mother smiled at Finn with real warmth. "Thank you so much. That was very kind."

Finn just nodded and moved away, returning to whatever task he'd been in the middle of. The whole interaction had taken maybe two minutes, but something about it stuck with me. The patience. The gentleness. The way he'd known exactly how to help without making the little boy feel small.

I filed it away, another detail in the overwhelming catalog of everything I was trying to learn about this place.

By the time Walt flipped the "CLOSED" sign at eight o'clock, my feet ached, my voice was hoarse, and I smelled like machine oil and sugared peanuts. But I'd done it. I'd made it through my first full day.

"How'd the till come out?" Walt asked as I counted my drawer for the third time, just like he'd taught me.

"Perfect. To the penny."

"Good girl." He pulled out a ledger and made a note. "You did fine today, Caroline. Real fine. See you tomorrow at eight-thirty."

I gathered my tips—a dollar seventy-five in coins that I wrapped carefully in a handkerchief—and added them to the five-dollar bill Walt had already counted out for my day's wages. Six dollars and seventy-five cents. Only two hundred ninety-three dollars and twenty-five cents to go.

Mother was waiting in our Bel Air in the parking lot, her hat perfectly straight, her gloves perfectly white. She'd insisted on driving me to and from work, at least for the first week. "Until we know what kind of people work there," she'd said, her voice tight with the worry she wore like armor.

"How was it?" she asked the moment I slid into the passenger seat.

"Fine. Good." I set my pocketbook in my lap, feeling the weight of the day's earnings. "Mr. Morrison—Walt—is very professional. Everything's very organized and respectable."

"And the other employees?" Mother pulled out of the parking lot, her eyes flicking toward me, then back to the road. "What kinds of people work there?"

I thought about the ticket seller with the gold tooth who'd winked at the pretty girls. The ride operator who'd been reading a racing form between customers. Finn Callahan with his toolbox and gentle hands, showing a little boy how to roll a skee-ball.

"Nice people," I said. "Normal people. Nobody you'd need to worry about."

Mother's shoulders relaxed slightly. "Well. That's good. You'll need to keep your focus, Caroline. No distractions. Just work, save your money, and keep your mind on September."

"Yes, Mother."

September. Secretarial school. The Plan. I'd heard it so many times I could recite it in my sleep. Work hard, save money, learn to type and file and take shorthand, get a respectable job, meet a respectable young man, marry by twenty-one, have a comfortable life. Security. Stability. Everything Mother had worked so hard to build for us after Daddy died.

I should have felt excited about it. Grateful, at least.

Instead, as we drove through Ocean Breeze toward our neat house on the south side, past the shops with their striped awnings and the church with its perfect white steeple, I felt...

I wasn't sure what I felt.

Just tired, probably. It had been a long day.

I counted my tips again when I got to my room, writing the total in the little notebook I'd started just for this purpose. Day One: $6.75. I tucked the money into the cigar box under my bed—the one Daddy had used for collar stays before he died—and changed out of my work clothes.

Through my window, I could see the twilight settling over Ocean Breeze, the last light catching on the ocean at the end of our street. Somewhere out there, the boardwalk lights were coming on. The arcade was closed and dark. Everyone had gone home.

I wondered, briefly, where Finn Callahan lived. Whether he'd worked other jobs after the arcade closed. Whether he was tired too.

Then I pulled the thought back, folded it away like a piece of clothing I had no business trying on. That wasn't the kind of thing I needed to be thinking about. I had a plan. I had a goal.

I just had to keep my head down and work toward it.

Only two hundred ninety-three dollars and twenty-five cents to go.
