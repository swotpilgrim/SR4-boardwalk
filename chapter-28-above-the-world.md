# Chapter 28: Above the World

The boardwalk hummed with anticipation.

Everyone was finding their spot for the fireworks—spreading blankets on the beach, claiming benches along the pier, positioning themselves for the best view of the sky. Vendors hawked sparklers and glow-in-the-dark necklaces. Children ran through the crowd with boundless energy despite the late hour. The band had taken a break, leaving the night filled with conversation and laughter and the eternal sound of waves.

Finn and I stood near the pier's edge, watching the preparations. In an hour, the sky would explode with color. But right now, this moment before, felt suspended. Charged with possibility.

"Come with me," Finn said suddenly.

"Where?"

He nodded toward the Ferris wheel. "One more ride. Before the fireworks start."

I looked at the wheel turning slowly against the darkening sky. The last time I'd ridden it—really ridden it, not just that first day with Ruby—everything had been different. I'd been different. Trying to figure out who I was when I stopped following scripts.

"Okay," I said.

We walked through the crowd hand in hand. I felt people watching, heard the whispers. But they didn't sting the way they used to. Let them watch. Let them judge. I knew who I was now. Knew what I'd chosen and why.

The Ferris wheel operator—a kid maybe sixteen—took our tickets and gestured us into a gondola. "Nice night for it," he said, grinning. "Best view in Ocean Breeze."

Finn helped me into the car, then settled beside me. The bar came down across our laps. The wheel lurched into motion, and we began to rise.

The boardwalk spread out below us. I could see Walt's arcade with its bright neon sign. The dance platform where couples still swayed to music from someone's radio. The beach dotted with families staking out territory. The pier stretching into dark water, its lights reflecting like fallen stars.

Higher still. The cannery came into view, its smokestacks dark for the holiday. The north end neighborhood where Mrs. Chen's boarding house sat—where my tiny room waited, proof that I could build something of my own. The south side in the distance, its neat streets and respectable houses where Mother was probably sitting in her living room, alone.

My chest tightened at the thought. But I didn't look away.

We reached the top of the arc and the wheel paused, loading more passengers below. Finn and I sat suspended above everything, the summer night warm around us, the approaching fireworks making the air electric.

"I've been thinking," Finn said quietly, "about fear."

I turned to look at him. "What about it?"

"I've been afraid for so long. Afraid of wanting things that seemed out of reach. Afraid of hoping for more than just survival." He was looking out at the view, but I could see something working in his expression. "When you grow up with nothing, you learn not to want. It hurts less that way."

"And now?"

"Now you've made me want to hope again." He met my eyes. "You've made me believe impossible things might actually be possible. That I deserve more than just getting by. That wanting something—someone—isn't foolish."

My throat tightened. "Finn—"

"I'm still terrified," he admitted. "Terrified I'll mess this up somehow. That I'll disappoint you or let you down or prove your mother right about everything." His voice dropped. "But I'm more terrified of going back to that numb place where I didn't let myself want anything."

I thought about his words. About the Finn I'd first met—guarded and careful and so convinced he didn't deserve good things. About how he'd gradually opened up, let me see his dreams, allowed himself to believe he mattered.

"I'm terrified too," I said. "Every day I think about my mother. About the look on her face when I chose to move out. About how I've hurt her by refusing her plan." I took a shaking breath. "I'm absolutely terrified of disappointing her."

"But you did it anyway."

"Because I'm more terrified of losing myself." The truth of it settled in my chest. "If I'd stayed, if I'd chosen safety over authenticity—I would have disappeared. Become this hollow version of Caroline Webb who looked right and acted right and was utterly empty inside."

Finn reached for my hand, threading our fingers together. "You're the bravest person I know."

"I'm not brave. I'm just desperate not to be a ghost."

"That's what brave means. Doing the terrifying thing because the alternative is worse." He squeezed my hand. "You chose yourself, Caroline. You risked everything—your home, your education fund, your mother's love. You gave up safety for the chance to be real."

"You taught me what courage looks like." I looked at him directly. "Watching you work toward impossible dreams. Seeing you refuse to accept the limitations everyone else imposed. Learning that survival isn't the same as living."

"I don't think I taught you anything. I think you already knew it. You just needed permission to believe it."

Maybe he was right. Maybe I'd always known, somewhere deep down, that I couldn't live Mother's safe, controlled life. That I needed more than approval and security. That I'd rather struggle honestly than thrive in a cage.

But meeting Finn had given me a mirror. Had shown me what it looked like to keep going when things were hard, to work toward something better even when it seemed impossible, to believe you deserved good things even when the world suggested otherwise.

"We've both changed," I said. "You're learning to hope. I'm learning to risk. We're both becoming something different than we were."

"Better, maybe. Or just more ourselves."

The wheel began to move again, carrying us down from our suspended moment. Below, the boardwalk was alive with celebration. Above, the sky waited for fireworks. And here, in this gondola, Finn and I sat with our hands clasped, understanding that we'd found something rare.

Not salvation—neither of us could save the other. But partnership. Two people choosing to build their lives together, making space for each other's dreams even when resources were scarce, believing in each other when self-belief failed.

"Do you remember the first time you rode this?" Finn asked as we descended.

"With Ruby. My first week at the arcade." I smiled at the memory. "I was so worried about everything. About doing my job right, about what Mother would think, about staying in my lane."

"And now?"

"Now I've jumped the tracks completely." The thought should have terrified me. Instead it felt freeing. "No more lane. No more safe path. Just me, figuring it out as I go."

"And me," Finn added. "If you want."

"I want." I looked at him, this boy who'd been dismissed and overlooked and invisible to so many people. Who I saw so clearly now—his intelligence, his determination, his quiet dignity. "I absolutely want."

We completed another revolution. Each time we reached the top, I could see farther—the ocean stretching to darkness, the town spreading inland, the whole complicated world we were trying to navigate. And each time we descended, we came back to the boardwalk, to reality, to the life we were building together.

But we were different now. Changed by the summer, by each other, by our own choices. We weren't the same people who'd met in June—Caroline trying to earn money for her mother's plan, Finn just surviving day to day.

We'd both expanded. Grown into ourselves. Become more honest, more brave, more real.

The wheel completed its cycle and came to a stop at the bottom. The operator lifted the bar, and Finn helped me out of the gondola. My legs felt unsteady—not from the ride, but from the conversation, from the weight of recognition.

"Thank you," I said as we walked back toward the pier.

"For what?"

"For suggesting the ride. For being honest about your fear. For seeing me even when I was trying to hide." I stopped and turned to face him fully. "For making hope feel possible instead of foolish."

Finn pulled me close, his arms around me, his forehead resting against mine. We stood like that while the boardwalk prepared for fireworks, while families found their spots and vendors made last sales and the band started playing again.

"We weren't above the world up there," I said quietly. "We were just finally seeing it clearly."

"Seeing each other clearly."

"That too."

Somewhere in the distance, I heard the first whistle of a test firework. The show would start soon. But right now, standing with Finn while the boardwalk celebrated around us, I felt suspended in the best possible way.

Not floating above reality. Not disconnected or separate. But present. Here. Fully myself in this moment with this person who'd helped me find my courage.

The view from the top had shown me the whole town—Mother's house in the south side, Mrs. Chen's boarding house in the north, the arcade where I worked, the ocean beyond everything. My old life and new life, the safe path and the risky one, the person I'd been and the person I was becoming.

All of it visible at once. All of it real.

But the most important view hadn't been of the town. It had been of Finn's face when he admitted he was learning to hope. Of my own reflection in his eyes when he called me brave. Of the two of us sitting suspended above everything, finally seeing clearly.

We'd both been afraid—Finn of wanting more, me of losing myself. And we'd both chosen to be afraid and keep going anyway. That's what this summer had taught us. That courage wasn't the absence of fear but the choice to act despite it.

"Come on," Finn said, taking my hand. "Let's find a good spot for the fireworks."

"Okay."

We walked toward the beach where people were gathered, still holding hands, still changed by what we'd said at the top of the wheel. The sky was fully dark now, pricked with early stars. Perfect for fireworks.

Perfect for this moment when summer peaked and everything felt possible.

I didn't know what would come next. Didn't know if Mother would ever forgive me, if Finn and I would make it through the hard years ahead, if our dreams of education and apartments and stable lives would actually materialize.

But I knew this: I'd chosen authenticity over approval. I'd risked everything to be real. And standing here with Finn while the boardwalk celebrated Independence Day, I felt more myself than I'd ever been.

The view from above had shown me that clearly.

And now, back on the ground, I carried that clarity with me.

Whatever came next, I'd face it honestly. Bravely. As myself.

That was enough.

More than enough.

It was everything.
