# Chapter 23: Choosing Her Path

Sunday morning, Finn met me outside Mrs. Chen's boarding house.

It was nothing like the south end. The building sat three blocks from the cannery, wedged between a corner tavern and a laundromat. Paint peeled from the shutters. The front steps sagged slightly. Laundry hung from lines between buildings, and somewhere nearby, someone's radio played music in a language I didn't recognize.

This was the north end. The part of town Mother drove through with locked doors and worried expressions. The part I'd been taught to fear.

It just looked tired to me. Worn down but still standing. Like the people who lived here.

"It's not much," Finn said, clearly nervous about my reaction. "But Mrs. Chen keeps it clean, and the price is fair. Twelve dollars a week for a room, shared bathroom down the hall."

Twelve dollars a week. I earned five dollars a day at the arcade, plus tips. If I worked six days a week, that was thirty dollars, maybe thirty-five with tips. After rent, I'd have twenty-three dollars for food, clothes, everything else.

It was possible. Barely. If nothing went wrong.

"Let's see it," I said.

Mrs. Chen was exactly what I'd expected and nothing like it. Tiny woman, maybe seventy, with sharp eyes and a sharper tongue. She looked me up and down when Finn introduced us, her expression skeptical.

"South-end girl," she said. Not a question. An observation. "Running away from home?"

"Moving out," I corrected. "There's a difference."

"Hmm. You work?"

"Ocean Breeze Arcade. Five dollars a day plus tips."

"Can you pay rent?"

"Yes."

"Can you pay it on time? Every week, no excuses, no crying about being short?"

I thought about the math I'd been doing all week. About how tight everything would be. About how one unexpected expense could sink me.

"Yes," I said anyway. Because what else could I say?

Mrs. Chen studied me for a long moment. Then she looked at Finn. "She your girl?"

Finn glanced at me, uncertain. "We're... it's complicated."

"Everything's complicated when you're young." Mrs. Chen snorted. "Room's upstairs. Third floor, back corner. Quiet. Clean. You break my rules, you're out. Understand?"

"What are the rules?"

"No men in rooms after ten. No noise after eleven. No drugs, no drinking, no fighting. Rent due Sunday morning. You're late, you pay extra. You're late twice, you're gone." She pulled a key from her pocket. "Want to see it or not?"

I followed her up three flights of narrow stairs, Finn trailing behind. The building smelled like cooking and soap and too many people living too close together. Music drifted from behind closed doors. A child cried somewhere above us.

The room was small. Maybe ten feet by twelve. A narrow bed, a dresser with a cracked mirror, a single window overlooking the alley behind the building. One overhead bulb for light. No closet—just hooks on the wall for hanging clothes.

This would be my home. This tiny space, in a building I'd been taught to fear, in a neighborhood Mother would never visit.

"Bathroom's shared," Mrs. Chen said, gesturing down the hall. "Six rooms, one bathroom. You learn to be fast. Hot water runs out by seven-thirty most mornings."

I walked to the window. From here, I could see the cannery smokestacks, the docks beyond, the ocean in the distance. No neat lawns. No painted shutters. No respectable middle-class veneer.

Just life, raw and real and honest.

"I'll take it," I said.

Mrs. Chen raised an eyebrow. "Just like that? No negotiating?"

"Would you negotiate?"

"No. Smart girl." She handed me the key. "First week's rent in advance. Move in whenever you're ready."

She left, her footsteps creaking down the stairs.

Finn stood in the doorway, watching me. "You sure about this? It's not too late to—"

"To what? Go back home and apologize? Beg Mother to take me back if I promise to be good?" I turned to face him. "I can't do that, Finn. I won't."

"It's going to be hard."

"I know."

"Really hard. This room is tiny. The neighborhood's rough. Mrs. Chen's rules are strict." He gestured at the space. "This is what choosing authenticity looks like in practice. Not romantic. Just difficult."

"Do you think I don't know that?" My voice came out sharper than I intended. "Do you think I'm some naive girl playing at independence? I've done the math, Finn. I know exactly how tight my budget will be. I know I'll be eating beans and rice for dinner most nights. I know I'll be sharing a bathroom with strangers and walking home alone after dark and living in a building my mother would call unsuitable."

"Then why are you doing it?"

"Because this—" I gestured at the tiny room, at the view of smokestacks and alleys, at the reality of choosing myself. "This is mine. I chose it. I'm building it. And yes, it's small and difficult and not what anyone wanted for me. But it's real. It's honest. And it's more mine than anything I've ever had."

Finn crossed the room and pulled me into his arms. "You're braver than anyone I've ever met."

"I'm terrified."

"I know. But you're doing it anyway. That's what brave means."

I let myself lean against him, just for a moment. Let myself feel the weight of what I'd chosen, the enormity of the change ahead.

Tomorrow I'd tell Mother I'd found a place. I'd start packing my things. I'd begin the practical work of separating my life from hers.

But today, standing in this tiny room with Finn's arms around me and my own key in my pocket—today I could just feel proud.

Proud that I'd chosen. Proud that I was following through. Proud that I was brave enough to be terrified and keep going anyway.

"I need to go home," I said eventually. "Tell Mother I found a room. Start packing."

"Want me to come with you?"

"No. This is something I need to do alone." I pulled back to look at him. "But I'll see you tomorrow? At the arcade?"

"Every day at the arcade."

"No more avoiding me?"

"No more avoiding." He kissed my forehead gently. "We're in this together now. Whatever comes."

I left him at Mrs. Chen's boarding house and walked home through Ocean Breeze. Past the cannery where workers were changing shifts. Past the corner stores where people bought groceries a meal at a time because that's all they could afford. Past the tavern where men stood outside smoking and talking.

Nobody bothered me. Nobody even looked at me twice. The north end, it turned out, was just people trying to get by. Same as everywhere else.

Mother was in the kitchen when I got home, washing dishes with mechanical precision.

"I found a room," I said from the doorway. "Mrs. Chen's boarding house. I can move in this week."

Mother's hands stilled in the dishwater. For a long moment, she didn't move. Then she resumed washing, her movements careful and controlled.

"I see."

"It's twelve dollars a week. I can afford it on my arcade salary."

"In the north end."

"Yes."

"With those people."

"With people who need cheap rent. Same as me."

Mother set down a plate with precise care. "This is really happening. You're really doing this."

"Yes."

"And nothing I say will change your mind."

"Mother, I love you. I'm grateful for everything you've done. But I need to live my own life. Make my own choices. Even if they're mistakes."

She turned to face me then, and I saw her face was wet. Not quite crying—Mother didn't cry—but wet nonetheless.

"I just wanted better for you," she said quietly. "I wanted you to never feel scared or vulnerable or desperate the way I did. And instead I've driven you away. Into exactly the situation I was trying to protect you from."

"Maybe I need to learn those things. Maybe being protected from everything isn't the same as being prepared for anything."

"And what if you can't do it? What if it's harder than you think and you fail?"

"Then I fail. And I learn from it. And I try again." I stepped into the kitchen. "But I need the chance to try. Even if it means falling."

Mother looked at me for a long moment. Then she nodded slowly. "I suppose I can't stop you."

"No."

"And you'll never forgive me if I keep trying to control you."

"I'll forgive you. Eventually. But I won't come back."

She turned back to her dishes. "Take what you need from your room. The rest I'll box up and store in the attic. In case..." Her voice caught. "In case you need it someday."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. I'm still furious with you." But her voice was softer now. Sad instead of angry. "Just... be careful. Please. That neighborhood isn't safe for a girl alone."

"I'll be careful."

I went upstairs and started packing. Clothes that would fit in one suitcase. Books I couldn't live without. The few things that were mine instead of Mother's vision of who I should be.

It wasn't much. But it was enough.

By evening, I was done. One suitcase, one bag of books, one box of personal items. Everything else—all the trappings of being Caroline Webb from the respectable south side—stayed behind.

I'd move out Friday morning. Five more days in this house. Five more days of careful distance and painful silence. Five more days of being between lives.

And then I'd be on my own.

The thought terrified and thrilled me in equal measure.

That night, lying in my childhood bed for one of the last times, I thought about how far I'd come. From the girl who started working at the arcade just to save money for her mother's plan, to someone choosing her own path even when it was hard.

From someone who thought she knew what she wanted, to someone brave enough to admit she had no idea but was going to figure it out anyway.

From playing it safe, to risking everything.

Five more days. And then the rest of my life began.

My life. My choices. My risks.

Mine.
