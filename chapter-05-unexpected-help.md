# Chapter 5: Unexpected Help

The following Saturday brought perfect beach weather. Which meant the boardwalk would be packed.

I thought I was ready.

I wasn't.

By eleven o'clock, the arcade was complete pandemonium. Every skee-ball lane occupied, kids three-deep at the pinball machines, a line for tokens stretching to the door. The noise was overwhelming—bells, buzzers, children shouting, mechanical clatter everywhere.

I worked as fast as I could. Sold tokens, made change, helped children count tickets, distributed prizes, answered the same questions over and over. But I could feel it building—the pressure of too many people wanting too many things too fast.

Then everything went wrong at once.

The token dispenser jammed first. Right in the middle of a rush, with five people waiting, it seized up completely. Tokens stuck halfway out, the mechanism frozen. A father with three impatient children demanded I fix it immediately.

"Just a moment," I said, my voice tight. I tried to clear the jam the way Walt had shown me, but my hands were shaking and I couldn't get the mechanism to release.

Then I heard crying. A little girl, maybe six years old, sobbing near the prize counter. She'd dropped her tickets—all of them, at least fifty—and they'd scattered across the floor where people were walking on them, stepping on them, kicking them aside.

"My tickets!" she wailed. "I need my tickets!"

Before I could move to help her, there was a crash from the back of the arcade. The claw machine. A teenage boy had been shaking it, trying to dislodge the stuffed animal his claw had grabbed but hadn't quite held. He'd shaken too hard. Now the whole machine was tilting dangerously, the boy backing away with his hands up like it wasn't his fault, while his friends laughed.

And through it all, the line at my counter kept growing. People pushing forward, demanding attention, everyone needing something right now.

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Couldn't figure out which crisis to handle first. The jammed dispenser? The crying child? The tilting claw machine? The impatient crowd?

My eyes burned with tears I couldn't afford to shed. Not here. Not in front of everyone.

Then suddenly Finn was there.

I hadn't called him. Hadn't even seen him approach. But he was moving past my counter, heading straight for the claw machine where the teenage boy still stood.

"Step back," Finn said quietly. Not angry, just firm. The kind of voice that expected to be obeyed.

The teenage boy bristled. "I didn't do anything—"

"Step back." Finn repeated it the same way, and something in his tone made the boy move.

Finn examined the machine, his hands on the sides, testing the tilt. Then he positioned himself at the front and pushed, rocking it carefully back onto its base. The machine settled with a solid thunk. Finn turned to the teenage boy and his friends.

"This machine weighs three hundred pounds," he said, still in that quiet voice. "You tip it, it'll crush whoever's standing in front of it. Maybe think about that next time."

The boys muttered something and walked away. Finn watched them go, then turned and surveyed the arcade. His eyes landed on the crying little girl surrounded by trampled tickets.

He knelt down beside her. "Hey there. Those your tickets?"

She nodded, hiccupping through her tears.

"Okay. You start picking up the ones you can reach, and I'll get the ones under people's feet. We'll find them all, don't worry."

He moved through the crowd with calm efficiency, collecting scattered tickets while the little girl gathered the ones nearby. Within two minutes, they had a crumpled pile of them. Finn counted them carefully—forty-seven surviving tickets—and then walked the little girl to my counter.

"This young lady has forty-seven tickets," he told me. "She'd like to see the prizes, please."

The girl's face lit up. Crisis solved.

But Finn was already moving again, heading to my counter where the jammed token dispenser was still causing problems and the line of impatient customers had grown longer.

"Caroline." It was the first time I'd heard him say my name. "Show me where it's jammed."

My hands were still shaking as I pointed to the mechanism. Finn leaned over the counter, examined it for maybe five seconds, then reached behind and did something I couldn't see. There was a click, and tokens came pouring out into the dispenser tray.

"Catch spring got stuck," he said. "Should be fine now."

Then he was helping the little girl choose her prize—a small stuffed dog that she clutched to her chest like treasure. He lifted her up so she could reach it from the top shelf, set her down gently, and she ran off to show her mother.

By now I'd started catching up with the line. Selling tokens again, the crisis past, everything returning to controlled chaos. But I kept glancing at Finn, watching him move through the arcade fixing problems I hadn't even noticed yet. A pinball machine that was about to tilt. A skee-ball that was rolling crooked. A small boy who couldn't reach the skee-ball lane properly—Finn lifted him, showing him how to roll, patient and kind.

I'd seen him do that before, on my first day. But this time I was really seeing it. The way he paid attention to everything happening around him. The way he anticipated problems before they became disasters. The way he was gentle with children, firm with teenagers who were causing trouble, efficient with mechanical issues.

He was keeping the whole place running, and nobody noticed except me.

At one o'clock, the arcade briefly emptied for lunch. I slumped against my counter, exhausted.

Finn appeared with a paper cup of water.

"Here," he said. "You look like you need it."

I drank it gratefully. "Thank you. For everything. You just showed up and—" I couldn't find the words. "Thank you."

"Saturdays get crazy. Jerry called in sick, so I figured you'd need help." He leaned against the counter. "You were drowning."

"I was. I had no idea what to do first."

"Token jam first, always. Then safety stuff. Then comfort." He said it like it was obvious. But I hadn't known it.

"How did you know I needed help? I didn't call you."

"You get a sense for it. You learn to watch for the signs."

"Well, I'm grateful you were watching." I met his eyes. "Really grateful."

Something shifted in his expression. Not quite a smile, but a softening. "You're tougher than you think."

Before I could respond, the lunch crowd started trickling back, and the chaos began building again. Finn pushed off from the counter.

"I'll stick close this afternoon," he said. "In case something else breaks."

He was as good as his word. For the rest of that endless Saturday, whenever I looked up from the counter, I could see Finn somewhere in the arcade. Fixing things. Helping people. Keeping watch.

And whenever things started to spiral—when three machines jammed at once, when a teenager tried to climb on the skee-ball lanes, when a mother couldn't find her son who'd wandered into the back room—Finn was there. Calm, efficient, solving problems before I even had to ask.

By the time eight o'clock came and Walt finally flipped the closed sign, I was so exhausted I could barely stand. My feet ached. My voice was gone. My hands hurt from making change all day.

But the till balanced perfectly. Every customer had been served. No disasters had occurred beyond what Finn had prevented. Somehow, we'd survived.

I found Finn outside the arcade, sitting on a bench facing the ocean, his toolbox beside him. The boardwalk was still busy with evening crowds, but he'd found a quiet spot away from the main flow of traffic.

"Hey," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. Hoarse from the day.

He looked up. "Hey."

"I wanted to say thank you again. For today. I don't think I could have managed without you."

"Sure you could have." But he said it kindly.

"No, really. You saved me today." I sat down on the bench, not quite beside him but not far away either. "You didn't have to do that. It's not your job to help me when I get overwhelmed."

"Walt would have wanted me to help. He doesn't like seeing his people struggle when there's something he can do about it."

"Still. You went above and beyond. And you were so patient with that little girl. And those boys at the claw machine—" I shook my head. "You're really good at this. At all of it."

Finn was quiet for a moment, looking out at the ocean. The late afternoon light caught on the waves, turning them gold and orange. Finally he said, "You were nice to me the other day. When the claw machine broke. You apologized for being rude, even though you didn't have to."

"I did have to. I was rude."

"Most people wouldn't have apologized. Most people would have just forgotten about it." He turned to look at me. "So I figured I'd return the favor. Be nice back."

Something warm spread through my chest. Not gratitude exactly, but something more complicated than that. The sense that something had shifted between us. That we'd moved from antagonism through awkward politeness into something that might actually be friendship.

"Well," I said softly. "Thank you for being nice back."

His mouth quirked into an almost-smile. "You're welcome."

We sat there for another moment, watching the waves and the evening crowd. Then Finn stood, picking up his toolbox.

"I've got to get to my next job. But you did good today, Caroline. Really good."

He walked away down the boardwalk, and I sat there watching him go, feeling something I couldn't quite name. Respect for how skilled he was, how observant, how kind. But also something else. Something about the way he'd looked at me like he really saw me—not Caroline Webb with her respectable plans, but just Caroline. Trying her best.

The same way I was starting to see him. Not as the maintenance boy, but as Finn. Someone worth knowing.

Mother was waiting in the parking lot. I told her about the Saturday rush, about learning to prioritize problems, about how the other workers helped when things got overwhelming.

I didn't mention Finn specifically. Mother wouldn't have understood.

But I thought about him all the way home. And that night when I added my tips to the cigar box, I found myself hoping for another quiet afternoon when maybe we'd have a chance to talk again.
