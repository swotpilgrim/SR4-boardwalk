# Chapter 12: Divided Attention

I couldn't focus on Monday.

A customer asked how many tokens for five dollars. I had to ask her to repeat the question twice.

A child wanted to exchange tickets for a prize. I handed her the wrong toy and didn't notice until her mother pointed it out.

I miscounted change three times in one hour.

My mind was somewhere else entirely. Specifically, it was on the fact that Finn was rewiring the electrical panel near the back of the arcade, and every time I glanced that way, I found myself watching him work instead of paying attention to my job.

The way his hands moved with such confidence. The way he'd push his hair back when it fell in his eyes. The way he'd explained the wiring system to me yesterday—patient and enthusiastic, like he was sharing something he loved.

"Caroline?" A woman's voice broke through my distraction. "Hello? The tokens?"

I snapped back to attention. "Sorry. Yes. Here you go."

I handed her the tokens—finally got it right—and tried to focus. But within five minutes, my eyes had drifted back to Finn again.

This was ridiculous. I was acting like those silly girls from school who couldn't concentrate because they were mooning over boys. I was better than this. I had responsibilities. Goals. A cash drawer that needed to balance at the end of the day.

Except every time Finn looked up and our eyes met across the arcade, every sensible thought in my head evaporated.

"Well, well," Ruby's voice said behind me. "If it isn't Caroline Webb, completely not thinking about a certain maintenance worker."

I jumped. "Ruby! What are you doing here?"

"Lunch delivery." She held up a paper bag. "And checking on my friend who's clearly been replaced by some distracted stranger. You just gave that customer two dollars too much change."

"What? No, I—" I looked at the register, mentally retraced my last transaction, and realized she was right. "Oh no."

"Ma'am?" Ruby called out to the customer who was already walking away. "You got too much change!"

The honest woman came back, returning the extra money with a smile. Crisis averted. But my face burned with embarrassment.

"Come on," Ruby said. "You need a break. Let's go outside."

We sat on a bench facing the ocean, the paper bag of sandwiches between us. Ruby had brought egg salad from the drugstore—my favorite. But I barely tasted it.

"Okay," Ruby said. "Talk."

"About what?"

"About why you're so distracted you can't count to ten. About why you keep looking at Finn like he's the only person in the arcade. About why you look absolutely miserable."

"I'm not miserable."

"Caroline, I've known you since we were six. You can't lie to me." She took a bite of her sandwich. "Martin Fletcher?"

"Mother arranged for him to drive me home Friday. He's very... proper."

"Proper. That's the most damning description I've ever heard." Ruby smiled slightly. "Let me guess—he talked about insurance the entire time?"

"Actuarial tables. Advancement opportunities. Mortality rates." I sighed. "He's taking me to the Independence Day concert. Mother already agreed for me."

"And you don't want to go."

"I don't want to go with him. Martin's fine. He's perfectly nice. He's exactly what Mother wants for me. And I feel absolutely nothing when I'm around him except the desperate urge to be somewhere else."

"With Finn."

It wasn't a question. I didn't bother denying it.

"I can't stop thinking about him, Ruby. I try to focus on work, on saving money, on The Plan. But then Finn walks by and my brain just... stops. He smiles at me and I forget what I was doing. He holds my hand for thirty seconds and I think about it for three hours."

"You've got it bad," Ruby said, but she said it gently.

"I know. And it's stupid because summer ends in six weeks. I'm supposed to start secretary school. He's supposed to keep working here. We have completely different lives, completely different futures. Mother would lose her mind if she knew. It's impossible."

"Is it? Or are you just telling yourself it's impossible because that's easier than fighting for what you want?"

I stared at the ocean. "What if I fight and lose? What if I stand up to Mother and she cuts me off completely? What if I give up secretarial school and then Finn and I don't work out anyway and I've thrown away my entire future for nothing?"

"What if you don't fight and spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been?" Ruby countered. "Caroline, I'm marrying Tommy because I love him. Not because he makes sense on paper or because my parents approve—though they do—but because when I'm with him, I'm happy. Actually, genuinely happy. And life's too short for anything less."

"You and Tommy have been together since you were fifteen. You know it's real. Finn and I have known each other for a month."

"Sometimes a month is enough. Sometimes you just know." Ruby squeezed my hand. "Do you feel different with him? Than you do with Martin or anyone else?"

I thought about it. About Martin's polite conversation that I could barely pay attention to. About the church boys Mother had introduced me to over the years—nice enough, forgettable. About how I'd felt standing in Finn's arms yesterday when he'd caught me falling, how I'd felt holding his hand, how I felt every time we talked about things that actually mattered.

"Yes," I admitted. "Completely different. Like I'm actually awake instead of just going through motions. Like what I think and feel and want actually matters."

"Then that's your answer."

"But it's not practical. It's not sensible. It's—"

"It's real." Ruby stood, gathering our sandwich wrappers. "You can spend your whole life being practical and sensible, Caroline. Or you can take a risk on something that makes you feel alive. Your choice."

She hugged me goodbye and headed back to the drugstore, leaving me alone with my thoughts and half a sandwich I had no appetite for.

When I went back inside, Finn had finished with the electrical panel and moved on to fixing a pinball machine near the front. I watched him work for a moment—the concentration, the competence, the careful attention to detail.

He looked up and caught me staring. For a second, neither of us moved. Then he smiled—just a small one, barely there, but enough to make my heart skip.

I smiled back.

And in that moment, sitting at my counter with customers waiting and a cash drawer to manage and a future full of impossible choices, I knew Ruby was right.

This was real. Whatever this was between Finn and me, it wasn't some silly summer flirtation. It wasn't a distraction or a phase.

It was the first real thing I'd ever felt.

The afternoon passed in a blur. I managed to focus better, got my counting right, handled customers without major disasters. But I was always aware of exactly where Finn was in the arcade. Like I had some internal compass that pointed toward him no matter what else I was doing.

Around three o'clock, during a lull, he came to my counter.

"Your friend Ruby seems nice," he said.

"She is. She brought lunch."

"That's good." He leaned against the counter, his usual careful distance. But his eyes were warm. "You okay? You seemed distracted this morning."

"I'm fine. Just tired."

"Liar." But he said it gently. "Something's bothering you."

I glanced around, made sure no one was close enough to overhear. "Mother set me up with Martin Fletcher. He's taking me to the Fourth of July concert."

Something flickered across Finn's face. Not quite hurt, but close. "The insurance guy your mother wants you to date?"

"I didn't agree to it. She agreed for me. I came home Friday and he was just there, and now it's arranged and I don't know how to get out of it without—"

"Without telling your mother why you don't want to go." Finn looked down at his hands. "Which you can't do because you're not supposed to be talking to me."

"I'm sorry. I don't know what to do."

"You should go." He said it firmly. "Martin's exactly what your mother wants for you. Stable job, good prospects, respectable family. You should give him a chance."

"I don't want to give him a chance. I want—" I stopped myself before I said too much.

"What do you want, Caroline?"

The question again. The same one everyone kept asking. But this time, standing there with Finn watching me with those serious dark eyes, I knew the answer.

I wanted this. Him. Us. Whatever we were becoming.

But saying it out loud would change everything. Make it real and undeniable. Force choices I wasn't sure I was brave enough to make.

"I want things to be less complicated," I said instead.

"Yeah." Finn straightened up. "Me too."

He walked away, back to his work, leaving me with the heavy knowledge that I was a coward. I knew what I wanted. I just wasn't brave enough to say it.

That evening, driving home with Mother chattering about fabric choices for my Independence Day dress, I thought about Ruby's question. Was I telling myself this was impossible because it actually was, or because being afraid was easier than fighting for what I wanted?

I didn't have an answer yet.

But I was starting to realize that not answering was itself a choice. That letting things happen to me instead of making active decisions was still choosing—choosing to let other people control my life.

And maybe it was time to stop choosing safety and start choosing truth.

Even if the truth was terrifying.

Especially if the truth was terrifying.

Because the only thing more frightening than taking a risk on something real was spending the rest of my life wondering what would have happened if I'd been brave enough to try.
