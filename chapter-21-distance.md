# Chapter 21: Distance

Finn pulled back completely.

It happened gradually, then all at once. Thursday afternoon, he sent another maintenance worker to fix a broken pinball machine. Friday morning, he came to check the electrical panel but did it before the arcade opened, when I wasn't there yet. Friday afternoon, when a skee-ball jammed, I looked for him and found he'd already left for his next job.

By Saturday, I understood what he was doing.

He was trying to make it easier for me. Trying to remove himself from the equation so I could make the "right" choice—the one that kept me fed and housed and educated.

The problem was, his absence made everything worse. Made the choice clearer instead of easier.

I went through my days like a ghost. Sold tokens, distributed prizes, smiled at customers with a face that felt like a mask. Mother and I existed in the same house without speaking. She made dinner. I ate. We cleaned up in silence. She'd given me until Sunday, and Sunday was two days away, and the weight of that deadline pressed down on everything.

Ruby came by Saturday afternoon with sandwiches from the drugstore.

"You look awful," she said, sitting beside me on the bench outside the arcade during my break.

"Thanks."

"I mean it, Caroline. You're not sleeping. You're barely eating. You're disappearing right in front of me."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're falling apart." She unwrapped a sandwich and pushed it at me. "Eat. Then talk."

I ate mechanically, tasting nothing. The sandwich could have been cardboard for all I noticed.

"Mother gave me until tomorrow to decide," I said finally. "Stop seeing Finn or lose everything. Education fund, college money, a place to live. Everything."

Ruby was quiet for a moment. "And what are you going to do?"

"I don't know. Every time I think I've decided, I second-guess myself." I set down the half-eaten sandwich. "If I choose Finn, if I walk away from everything Mother's offering, I'll be completely on my own. No safety net. No backup plan. Just me and whatever I can scrape together."

"Can you do it? Support yourself?"

"I don't know. Maybe. People do it every day. But they usually have more than three days to figure it out."

"What does Finn say?"

"Nothing. He's avoiding me." The words came out bitter. "I think he's trying to make the decision easier by removing himself from it. Like if he's not around, I'll naturally choose the sensible option."

"That's not how feelings work."

"I know. But I also understand why he's doing it. He doesn't want to be the reason I lose everything. He's trying to be noble." I laughed without humor. "Everyone's trying to be noble. Mother thinks she's protecting me. Finn thinks he's protecting me. And I'm just trying to figure out who I am when I'm not being protected."

Ruby squeezed my hand. "What do you want? Really, truly want?"

"I want to not have to choose. I want Mother to accept Finn. I want Finn to stop pushing me away for my own good. I want to be brave enough to risk everything without being terrified." I looked at her. "But mostly? I want to stop living someone else's life."

"Then that's your answer."

"Is it? Because I'm not sure being brave is enough. What if I choose wrong? What if I lose everything and it turns out I'm not strong enough to make it on my own?"

"Then you learn. You stumble. You figure it out." Ruby's voice was gentle but firm. "Caroline, safe choices might protect you from failing, but they also protect you from living. And I've watched you this summer—you're not the same person who started working at that arcade. You're stronger. Braver. More yourself."

"I don't feel stronger. I feel like I'm breaking."

"Maybe that's what strength looks like sometimes. Breaking open instead of staying safely closed."

We finished lunch in silence, and Ruby left with promises to call tomorrow, after I'd made my decision. I returned to work feeling hollowed out, exhausted from the weight of choosing.

Walt found me during the afternoon lull, counting tickets with hands that couldn't quite stay steady.

"Caroline." He leaned against my counter. "Can I tell you something?"

"Sure."

"I knew your father. Not well, but enough to respect him. He was a good man. Worked hard, loved his family, died too young." Walt's voice was thoughtful. "But you know what I remember most about him?"

I shook my head.

"He took risks. Opened his own business when everyone said he'd fail. Married your mother when her family didn't approve—she came from money, he didn't. He made choices that scared people." Walt looked at me directly. "Your mother loved that about him, even though it terrified her. And when he died, I think that terror got louder than everything else."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I see you struggling. And I see your mother struggling. And I want you to know something." He straightened up. "Some cages are built with love. People who care about you, genuinely care, can still trap you with their fear. Doesn't make the cage any less confining."

The words hit me like cold water.

"You think I should choose Finn."

"I think you should choose Caroline." Walt's expression was kind. "I don't know if that means choosing Finn or choosing security or choosing something else entirely. But I know you can't keep living half a life to make other people comfortable."

He walked away, leaving me with his words echoing in my head.

That evening, Mother tried one last time.

She found me in my room, packing a small bag—just in case. Just so I'd be prepared if tomorrow I chose myself and needed to leave quickly.

"Caroline." She stood in the doorway, her face drawn. "Please. Can we talk?"

I sat on my bed. "Okay."

She came in and sat beside me, not touching, just close. For a long moment, she said nothing. Then:

"I lost your father when I was thirty-two years old. One day he was there, and the next he was gone. Heart attack. No warning. Just... gone." Her voice cracked. "And suddenly I was alone with a six-year-old daughter and no income and no skills and no idea how to survive."

"Mother—"

"Let me finish. Please." She took a shaking breath. "People were kind. The church collected money. Friends brought casseroles. But charity has a shelf life, Caroline. Eventually people move on, and you're still struggling, still scared, still vulnerable. And I vowed—I vowed—that my daughter would never experience that. Never be that desperate."

"I know you're trying to protect me."

"I'm trying to save you from making the same mistakes I did. From choosing passion over security and paying for it the rest of your life." She looked at me with wet eyes. "I loved your father. But loving him left me vulnerable. And I can't watch you make that same choice."

"What if it's not a mistake? What if choosing honestly is worth the risk?"

"It's not worth it when the risk is everything." Mother's voice hardened again. "Tomorrow, Caroline. You have until tomorrow to come to your senses. Choose wisely."

She left, closing the door gently behind her.

I lay in bed that night staring at the ceiling, thinking about everything Walt had said. About cages built with love. About my father, who'd taken risks even though they scared people.

About Finn, who was avoiding me to make my choice easier.

About Mother, whose love had calcified into control.

About myself, and who I was when I stopped trying to please everyone.

Sunday morning dawned gray and heavy. I dressed in my plainest clothes—nothing yellow and cheerful, nothing that suggested I was anything but serious about this decision.

I found Mother in the kitchen, already dressed for church. She looked like she hadn't slept either.

"Well?" she asked. Just that one word.

I took a breath, and then another, and then I said the words that would change everything.

"I can't do what you're asking."

Mother's face went white. "Caroline—"

"I'm grateful for everything you've given me. I know you love me. I know you're scared." My voice shook but stayed firm. "But I can't live your life anymore. I have to live mine."

"Even if it means losing everything?"

"Even then."

We stood in the kitchen while my words hung in the air between us. Mother's hands clenched and unclenched. Her face worked through a dozen emotions—anger, fear, grief, disbelief.

Finally, she spoke.

"Then I'll need you to be out by the end of the week. I can't stop you from ruining your life, but I won't enable it."

"I understand."

"Do you? Do you really understand what you're giving up?"

"Yes. But I also understand what I'd be giving up if I chose your way. And that cost is higher."

Mother turned away. "I'll be at church. Pack your things. You can stay until Friday, but then..." Her voice broke. "Then you're on your own."

She left through the front door, and I heard her car start and drive away.

I stood in the empty kitchen, shaking, trying to process what I'd done.

I'd chosen. Finally, irrevocably, I'd chosen.

And now I had five days to figure out how to survive that choice.
