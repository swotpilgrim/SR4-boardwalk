# Chapter 18: Acknowledgment

I made it through the rest of Saturday somehow.

Martin found me, his face tight with confusion.

"Caroline, where were you? I waited by the restroom for fifteen minutes."

"I'm sorry. I got distracted."

"Distracted? By what?"

By everything. By realizing the truth. By finally choosing.

"I wasn't feeling well," I said instead. "The height made me dizzy. I need to go home."

Martin's irritation shifted to concern. "Of course. Let me drive you home. We should notify your mother—"

"No need. I already saw her." Another lie, but I'd tell Mother myself. I wasn't ready for that conversation yet.

The drive home was mercifully short. Martin kept glancing at me with worried eyes, asking if I needed a doctor, if I'd eaten something disagreeable, if the sun had been too much.

"I just need to rest," I said for the fifth time.

"Of course. I'll telephone tomorrow to check on you."

"That's not necessary—"

"Nonsense. It's the proper thing to do." He pulled up in front of my house. "I hope you feel better soon, Caroline. And do let me know if you need anything. Anything at all."

I thanked him and escaped into the house, my heart still racing from the Ferris wheel, from holding Finn's hand, from the look in Finn's eyes when I'd said I was sure.

From the terrifying, exhilarating feeling of finally choosing something for myself.

Mother came home two hours later, full of gossip from the celebration. Martin hadn't told her anything—probably assuming I really had been sick. But the gossip network worked fast in Ocean Breeze.

"Mrs. Henderson mentioned she saw you with that boy," Mother said over dinner, her voice deceptively casual. "The maintenance worker. Finn something."

My stomach clenched. "Finn Callahan. And yes, I spoke with him. He was working the Ferris wheel machinery."

"Spoke with him. How friendly." Mother cut her pot roast with precise movements. "Mrs. Henderson seemed to think you looked quite... involved in your conversation."

"We work together, Mother. We're colleagues."

"Colleagues." She said it like she didn't believe me. "And that's all?"

"What else would there be?"

The lie tasted bitter. But I wasn't ready—not yet—to have the fight I knew was coming. I needed time. Time to figure out what I was doing, what I wanted, how to stand up to Mother without destroying our relationship completely.

"I just want you to remember what we discussed," Mother said carefully. "About focusing on appropriate people. About your future. About Martin."

"I remember."

"Good." She relaxed slightly. "Martin is a good man, Caroline. Stable. Respectable. He'll take care of you."

I didn't say that I didn't want to be taken care of. That I wanted to take care of myself. That stable and respectable felt like a prison sentence.

I just nodded and finished my dinner in silence.

That night, lying in bed, I couldn't stop thinking about the Ferris wheel. About sitting beside Finn while the world fell away beneath us. About his question—what are you doing with me?—and my answer—choosing you.

About his hand in mine as we walked away together.

I'd crossed a line today. Made a public choice that couldn't be taken back. People had seen. People would talk. And sooner or later, Mother would hear the whole truth.

But I couldn't bring myself to regret it.

For the first time in my life, I'd done something just because I wanted to. Not because it was appropriate or sensible or what someone else thought I should do. Just because it felt right.

It terrified me. But it also felt like breathing after being underwater too long.

Sunday at the arcade was strange. I kept expecting Finn to avoid me, to pretend yesterday hadn't happened, to put distance between us for both our sakes.

Instead, he appeared at my counter mid-morning with two cups of lemonade.

"Brought you this," he said, setting one down beside my till.

I stared at the cup. "You brought me lemonade."

"You've been bringing me lemonade for weeks. Figured it was my turn." He leaned against the counter, his expression serious. "We should probably talk. About yesterday."

My heart sped up. "Okay."

"Not here. Too many ears." He glanced around the busy arcade. "Can you take a break this afternoon? Maybe around two?"

"I'll ask Walt."

"Good. Meet me by the pier. The far end, where nobody goes."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me with a cup of lemonade and a stomach full of nervous anticipation.

Two o'clock felt like years away.

Walt had no problem with me taking a break. "You've been working hard all summer," he said. "Go on. Just be back by three."

I found Finn right where he said he'd be, sitting on the weathered pier boards with his legs dangling over the edge, watching the ocean roll beneath us. He'd changed out of his work shirt into a clean t-shirt, and he'd washed the grease off his hands.

He'd gotten ready for this conversation.

"Hey," I said, sitting down beside him.

"Hey."

We sat in silence for a moment, just watching the waves. Finally, Finn spoke.

"I couldn't sleep last night. Kept thinking about what you said yesterday. About choosing to be honest instead of safe."

"Did you decide I was crazy?"

"No. I decided you were braver than anyone I've ever met." He looked at me. "But Caroline, I need to make sure you understand what you're doing. What you're risking."

"I know what I'm risking."

"Do you? Really?" He turned to face me fully. "You're risking your mother's approval. Your college fund. Your entire planned future. And for what? For me? Someone who can't offer you anything?"

"You're not nothing, Finn."

"I'm a high school dropout who fixes broken machines. In your mother's eyes, in this whole town's eyes, I'm exactly nothing." His voice was matter-of-fact, no self-pity. Just stating facts. "And if you're with me—if people see us together—they'll judge you. They'll say you threw away your future for summer romance with the wrong kind of boy."

"Then let them say it."

"You say that now—"

"I mean it." I grabbed his hand, making him look at me. "Finn, listen. I've spent seventeen years trying to be what everyone else wanted. The perfect daughter. The good girl. The respectable future wife. And you know what? I was miserable. I was sleepwalking through my own life."

"So wake up. But don't throw everything away in the process."

"What if everything I'd be throwing away isn't worth keeping?" I squeezed his hand. "What if the only thing worth having is the thing that's real?"

Finn studied our joined hands, his calloused thumb tracing circles on my palm. "And this is real? You're sure?"

"I've never been more sure of anything."

"Even though I can't promise you security? Or stability? Or any of the things Martin Fletcher could give you?"

"Especially then. Because Martin's security would cost me myself. And I've finally figured out that losing everything else is worth it if I can keep being me."

Finn was quiet for a long moment. Then he lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it gently—just a soft brush of his mouth against my knuckles.

"You scare the hell out of me," he said quietly. "In the best possible way."

"You scare me too."

"Good. At least we're equally terrified." He lowered my hand but didn't let go. "So what do we do now? We can't hide this. People already saw us yesterday. Your mother's going to hear."

"I know."

"And when she does, she'll probably forbid you from seeing me. She might even pull you from your job here."

"Then I'll get another job."

"Caroline—"

"I'm serious, Finn. I'm done letting other people control my life." I looked at him. "But I need you to want this too. I need you to stop trying to protect me from consequences and just... be honest. Do you want this? Do you want to try, even though it'll be difficult?"

His dark eyes searched mine. "I've wanted you since you brought me lemonade and actually cared about my engineering book. I've just been too smart to let myself hope for it."

"Then stop being smart. Hope for it anyway."

"That's terrible advice."

"I know." I smiled. "But it's the best I've got."

Finn laughed—actually laughed, warm and real. Then he pulled me closer, his arm around my shoulders, and kissed the top of my head.

"Okay," he said against my hair. "Okay. We'll try. Even though it's crazy. Even though I have no idea how this ends."

"Nobody knows how things end. That's what makes them worth doing."

We sat there for the rest of my break, his arm around me, watching the ocean and not talking about all the ways this could go wrong. Just existing in this moment where we'd chosen each other and nothing else mattered.

For now, that was enough.

When I returned to the arcade, Ruby was waiting by my counter with her arms crossed and her eyes knowing.

"So," she said. "Are you going to tell me about it, or am I going to have to torture it out of you?"

"Tell you about what?"

"Caroline Webb. Don't play innocent with me. Everyone saw you and Finn yesterday. And you just came back from break looking like someone who's been thoroughly kissed."

"He kissed my hand. That's all."

"That's all?" Ruby grinned. "Caroline, this is exactly what I've been telling you to do! Choose what makes you happy! Follow your heart!"

"Well, I did. And now I'm terrified."

"Of course you are. But you're also glowing. So I think you made the right choice." She hugged me quickly. "Whatever happens with your mother, whatever people say—you have me. You remember that."

I hugged her back, grateful for this friendship that asked nothing of me except honesty.

"Thank you."

"Now." She pulled back, her expression turning serious. "You need to prepare for the storm. Because it's coming. You know that, right?"

"I know."

"And you're ready?"

I thought about Finn's question. Was I sure? Was I ready to lose everything for this uncertain thing between us?

"No," I admitted. "But I'm going to do it anyway."

Ruby smiled. "That's my girl."

That evening, I told Mother I needed to talk to her.

"Of course, dear. What is it?"

"Not now. But soon. I need to figure out how to say it first."

She looked concerned. "Is everything alright?"

"Everything's changing. But I think maybe it's changing in the right direction."

Mother frowned, clearly confused. But she didn't press.

She'd learn soon enough.

We all would.

For now, I had this—the memory of Finn's kiss on my hand, Ruby's support, my own certainty that I'd made the right choice even if it was the hard one.

And tomorrow, I'd start dealing with the consequences.
