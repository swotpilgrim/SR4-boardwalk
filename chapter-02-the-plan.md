# Chapter 2: The Plan

Sunday dinner at the Webb house never changed. Pot roast at six o'clock, cooked until the meat fell apart under Mother's fork. Boiled potatoes with butter and parsley. Carrots from Mrs. Henderson's garden next door. Green beans that Mother had put up in mason jars last summer. The good china—the set with the pink roses that had been Grandmother Webb's. The dining room table with its starched white cloth.

The conversation never changed either.

"You'll want to save at least three hundred dollars," Mother said, passing me the carrots. "That covers tuition for the full secretarial program at Miss Porter's Business College. Six months of instruction—typing, shorthand, filing systems, business correspondence, telephone manner. Everything a young woman needs for a respectable career."

"Yes, Mother." I'd heard this before. Many times before.

"Of course, if you save more than three hundred, that's better. You'll need clothes for school. Appropriate clothes—skirts, blouses, a good wool suit for interviews. Sensible shoes. Nothing flashy, nothing that draws the wrong kind of attention." She cut her pot roast into precise squares. "A young woman in business must look professional at all times."

"Yes, Mother."

"And then there are the church socials. I've already spoken to Reverend Matthews about making sure you're included in the young adult activities this fall. That's where you'll meet appropriate young men—boys from good families with prospects. Not these boardwalk types." Her nose wrinkled slightly, as if she'd smelled something unpleasant. "Working at the arcade is fine for the summer, for earning money, but those aren't the kind of people you'd want to associate with socially."

I focused on my potatoes. They were perfectly cooked, perfectly buttered, perfectly tasteless in my mouth.

"By the time you're twenty-one, you should be married. Or at least engaged." Mother set down her fork and looked at me directly. "I know that seems young to you now, Caroline, but believe me—a woman needs security. She needs a husband with a steady income, a man who can provide. That's what I'm working toward for you. That's what all this planning is for."

"I know, Mother. I'm grateful." The words came automatically, smooth as water.

"I just want you to have what I didn't." Her voice softened, the way it sometimes did when she talked about Daddy. "When your father died, I had nothing. No skills, no income, a child to raise. Do you know what that feels like? To be completely dependent on other people's charity?"

"No, Mother."

"No, you don't. Because I've made sure of that." She picked up her fork again. "I've worked very hard to give you opportunities, Caroline. To make sure you'll never be vulnerable the way I was. This plan—secretarial school, a good job, a respectable marriage—this is your security. This is your future."

"Yes, Mother."

"Oh, and speaking of appropriate young men—" Her expression brightened artificially, the way it did when she was particularly pleased about something. "Martin Fletcher asked about you at church this morning."

My stomach did something uncomfortable. "Martin Fletcher?"

"Yes, you know Martin. Harold Fletcher's son. He works for Metropolitan Life Insurance—very good company, excellent benefits. He's twenty-four, established in his career, drives that nice new sedan. He mentioned he might telephone you about the Independence Day band concert."

I tried to remember Martin Fletcher. Tall? Short? Did he have brown hair or blond? I had a vague memory of a man in a conservative suit lingering near Mother after services, talking about something tediously serious.

"I don't really know him, Mother."

"That's why he'd like to take you to the concert, dear. To get to know you properly." Mother smiled, a tight little smile of satisfaction. "I told him you'd be delighted. The Fourth of July concert is a lovely event—very respectable, lots of families. Perfect for a first outing."

"You told him I'd go?" The words came out sharper than I intended.

Mother's smile thinned. "I told him you'd be pleased to attend with him, yes. Caroline, this is exactly the kind of opportunity I've been talking about. Martin Fletcher is precisely the type of young man you should be meeting. Stable employment, good family, proper ambitions. You could do much worse."

I could do much worse. That was the standard, apparently. Not "you could be happy" or "you might fall in love." Just "you could do much worse."

"I understand," I said quietly.

"Good." Mother stood, gathering plates. "Now, let's do these dishes, and then I have something to show you."

We washed and dried in silence—Mother washing, me drying, the same choreography we'd performed a thousand times. The china plates with their pink roses. The silver that had been Grandmother's. The crystal glasses saved for Sunday dinners. Everything in its place, everything predictable, everything exactly as it should be.

When the last dish was put away, Mother led me to my bedroom. On my desk, arranged prominently next to my lamp, was a brochure. "Miss Porter's Business College for Young Ladies," the cover announced in elegant script. Below the title, a photograph showed a young woman in a neat suit, sitting at a typewriter, smiling at something outside the frame. Her hair was perfectly curled, her lipstick perfectly applied, her expression perfectly content.

She looked nothing like how I felt.

"I picked this up from Miss Porter herself last week," Mother said, touching the brochure lightly. "She remembers you from when you toured the school last year. She said she'd be delighted to have you in the fall program."

I stared at the photograph. The woman at the typewriter seemed to be looking through me, her smile fixed and distant, as if she were miles away from where she was sitting.

"Look at the curriculum." Mother opened the brochure, pointing to the list of courses. "Business typing—sixty words per minute by graduation. Gregg shorthand. Office procedures and filing systems. Business correspondence and letter formatting. Telephone etiquette. You'll be qualified for excellent positions, Caroline. Law firms, doctor's offices, maybe even the bank. Respectable work with respectable pay."

"It looks very thorough," I managed.

"It is. Miss Porter's has an excellent reputation. And the best part—" Mother turned to the back page, where testimonials from former students praised the school. "Look at all these girls who found good positions. This one married a lawyer. This one works for a judge. This one manages an entire office for a manufacturing company. These are successful young women, Caroline. This could be you."

Could be me. Should be me. Would be me, if I followed The Plan.

"I'll put this right here on your desk," Mother said, propping the brochure against my lamp. "So you can look at it whenever you need motivation. Every dollar you earn at that arcade, every tip you collect—it's all going toward this. Toward your future."

"Yes, Mother. Thank you."

She kissed my forehead, a rare gesture of affection. "I know you'll make me proud, dear. You always do."

Then she was gone, closing my door softly behind her, leaving me alone with the woman in the photograph and her perfect smile.

I sat on my bed and stared at the brochure. I tried to imagine myself there, sitting at a typewriter in a neat suit, smiling that contented smile. I tried to imagine working in a law office or a doctor's waiting room, typing letters and answering telephones and filing correspondence in alphabetical order. I tried to imagine Martin Fletcher picking me up after work, taking me to respectable restaurants, eventually proposing with a modest ring and a mortgage on a modest house.

I tried to imagine being happy.

The problem was, I couldn't see it. Not really. It was like looking at one of those paintings in the library—technically perfect, properly composed, but somehow flat. Two-dimensional. Something to admire from a distance but never actually step into.

Was this what everyone felt? Did everyone spend their lives following plans that other people made for them, wearing clothes that didn't quite fit, preparing for futures that felt like someone else's dreams?

Or was it just me? Was there something wrong with me, that I couldn't feel grateful for everything Mother was offering? She'd worked so hard. Sacrificed so much. Built this path for me stone by careful stone, every decision designed to keep me safe, keep me secure, keep me from ever experiencing the fear and vulnerability she'd known.

I should be grateful.

I was grateful.

I just wasn't sure I was happy.

Through my window, I could see the last light fading over Ocean Breeze. The streetlamps were coming on, casting yellow pools on the sidewalk. Mrs. Henderson was bringing in her wash from the line. Mr. Cooper from three houses down was watering his roses. Everything peaceful, everything orderly, everything in its proper place.

Somewhere beyond the neat houses and manicured lawns and respectable church steeple, the boardwalk was coming alive for the evening. Lights stringing between the buildings. Music drifting from the dance pavilion. Teenagers walking hand in hand along the pier, eating ice cream, laughing at nothing in particular. The Ferris wheel turning slowly against the darkening sky, carrying people up and up and up until they could see the whole town spread below them.

I'd never ridden the Ferris wheel. Mother said it wasn't safe.

I pulled my nightgown from the drawer and changed for bed, folding my Sunday dress carefully and hanging it in the closet. The dress I'd wear next Sunday, and the Sunday after that, sitting in the same pew, listening to the same sermon, eating the same pot roast, hearing the same plan for my future.

Only two hundred ninety-three dollars and twenty-five cents to go until September.

Until the typewriter and the neat suit and the perfect smile.

Until the future everyone else had decided I should want.

I climbed into bed and turned off the lamp, but I didn't close my eyes. Instead I lay there in the darkness, listening to Mother moving around downstairs, putting things away, preparing for Monday morning, maintaining the careful order of our lives.

And I wondered—just for a moment, just in the privacy of my own head where no one could hear—what would happen if I wanted something different.

What would happen if The Plan wasn't mine at all.
