# Chapter 22: Breaking Point

The boardwalk dance arrived on schedule, indifferent to my personal crisis.

I'd spent the week looking for jobs—any jobs—and finding nothing that paid enough to cover rent and food. I'd looked at rooms for rent and discovered that even the cheapest options cost more than I could afford on my arcade salary alone. I'd lain awake every night doing math that didn't add up, trying to figure out how to make independence work with five dollars a day plus tips.

And through it all, Finn stayed away.

I was furious with him for that. For trying to make my choice easier by removing himself from the equation. For deciding what was best for me instead of letting me decide for myself.

But I was also grateful, in a twisted way. Because his absence made one thing absolutely clear: I wasn't choosing him. I was choosing me. The person I was becoming when I stopped following scripts and started writing my own story.

Even if that story currently involved a lot of uncertainty and fear.

Saturday evening, the boardwalk transformed. String lights everywhere, tables set up on the pier, a live band tuning their instruments on a makeshift stage. Walt had gone all out—decorations, refreshments, the works. Every attraction stayed open late, and every employee was expected to attend and look presentable.

I wore my arcade uniform—the closest thing I had to "looking presentable" now that I'd packed most of my clothes. Mother had barely spoken to me all week. We existed in the same house like polite strangers, circling each other carefully, both waiting for Friday when I'd leave and this awful tension could finally end.

The dance started at seven. By seven-thirty, the boardwalk was packed with couples and families, everyone dressed up and smiling, celebrating summer and music and life.

I worked my counter, selling tokens to dancers who wanted to play arcade games between songs, distributing prizes to children while their parents slow-danced nearby. Normal work. Normal evening.

Except nothing about tonight felt normal.

At eight o'clock, Martin Fletcher appeared at my counter.

I'd successfully avoided him all week. Hadn't returned his phone calls, had claimed I was too busy for visitors. But there was no avoiding him now.

"Caroline." He smiled, oblivious as always. "You look lovely tonight."

I looked exhausted and worried and like I'd barely slept in days. But Martin saw what he wanted to see.

"Hello, Martin."

"I hoped I might convince you to take a break? Share a dance? The band is quite good, and I've been looking forward to this all week."

"I'm working—"

"Surely Walt can spare you for one dance?" Martin's tone was pleasant but insistent. "I've been very patient about your... illness... last weekend. I think I deserve a few minutes of your time."

He wasn't asking. He was informing me. The way he'd informed me about every date, every plan, every future he'd mapped out without ever asking if I wanted it.

"Martin, I don't think—"

"Come now. Just one dance. It's the least you can do."

Something inside me snapped. The least I could do. Like I owed him something. Like my time, my attention, my entire future was his by right.

"Actually, I can't," I said, my voice harder than I'd intended. "I'm working until closing. Maybe find someone else to dance with?"

Martin's smile tightened. "Caroline, I don't appreciate this attitude. I've been nothing but patient with you, and this is how you repay me? With rudeness and disrespect?"

"I'm not being rude. I'm being honest. I don't want to dance with you, Martin."

His face flushed. "I see. This is about that boy, isn't it? That maintenance worker everyone's talking about? You're throwing away a good man for—"

"For someone who actually sees me. Yes." I was done pretending. Done being polite. "I'm sorry if I led you on. But I never wanted any of this. My mother wanted it. And I was too afraid to say no until now."

"You're making a mistake."

"Maybe. But it's my mistake to make."

Martin stared at me, his expression cycling through shock, anger, and finally disdain. "You'll regret this, Caroline. When you're struggling to make ends meet, when that boy can't provide for you, when you realize what you've thrown away—you'll regret it."

"Probably. But I'll regret it honestly." I looked him in the eyes. "Goodbye, Martin."

He left without another word, his back rigid with wounded pride.

I stood behind my counter, shaking slightly, feeling like I'd just jumped off something very high. No more safety net with Martin. No more fallback option if things with Finn didn't work out. I'd just burned that bridge completely.

It felt terrifying and exhilarating all at once.

"Well done."

I turned. Walt stood there, his expression approving.

"I probably shouldn't have been so blunt."

"Nonsense. That boy needed some honesty. Been proposing to girls in his head without asking them first for years." Walt leaned on my counter. "You look like you could use a break. Go on. Take an hour. I'll watch the arcade."

"I'm supposed to work—"

"You're supposed to live, too. Go on. Dance. Enjoy yourself. You've earned it."

I stepped out from behind the counter, suddenly unsure what to do with this unexpected freedom. The dance was in full swing—couples spinning across the pier, the band playing something upbeat and jazzy, laughter and conversation mixing with music.

And there, standing alone near the edge of the pier, was Finn.

He was watching the dance with that same expression I'd seen before—guarded, careful, like he was observing a world he didn't quite belong to. He'd cleaned up—wore jeans and a button-down shirt instead of his usual work clothes—but he still stood apart. Still separate.

Still alone.

I walked toward him, my heart pounding, not sure what I was going to say. Just knowing I couldn't stand at my counter one more minute pretending I didn't see him, didn't miss him, didn't choose him over and over every day.

He saw me coming and straightened up, surprised.

"Caroline." He said my name carefully, like he was testing whether we were still allowed to talk to each other. "I didn't think you'd be here."

"Walt made everyone come. Employee morale or something." I stopped a few feet away, suddenly shy. "You've been avoiding me."

"I was trying to make it easier. Let you make your choice without pressure."

"That's not how it works. Avoiding me just made me realize how much I—" I stopped, not sure how to finish that sentence without saying too much.

Finn's expression softened. "How much you what?"

"How much I miss you when you're not around. How much easier everything is when I can talk to you. How much I want..." I gestured helplessly at the dance, at the boardwalk, at everything. "This. Whatever this is."

"And your mother? The ultimatum?"

"I chose. I'm moving out Friday. I have five days to figure out where and how, but I chose." I looked at him directly. "I chose me. And you're part of that choice, whether you like it or not."

Finn's face did something complicated. "Caroline—"

"I know you're going to say it's not smart. That I'm throwing away everything. That you can't offer me anything. I've heard it all before." I stepped closer. "But right now, I don't care about smart. I don't care about security. I just want to dance with someone who actually wants to dance with me."

"I can't dance."

"Neither can I. We'll figure it out together."

For a moment, Finn just looked at me. Then slowly, carefully, he held out his hand.

I took it.

He led me onto the pier where other couples were dancing. The band was playing something slow now, a ballad about summer nights and promises. Finn pulled me close—closer than was probably proper—his hand on my waist, mine on his shoulder, our other hands clasped between us.

"I don't know the steps," he admitted.

"Just sway. Nobody's watching anyway."

Except people were watching. I could feel the stares, hear the whispers starting. The south-end girl dancing with the maintenance boy. Caroline Webb throwing away her future for summer romance.

Let them watch. Let them whisper. I was done living my life for an audience.

"I tried to stay away," Finn said quietly, his breath warm against my ear. "Tried to make it easier for you to choose the sensible option. But it about killed me."

"Then stop trying. Stop deciding what's best for me. Just be here."

"I am here. I'm always here." He pulled back slightly to look at me. "But Caroline, are you sure? Really sure? Because once you move out, once you cut ties with your mother—there's no going back."

"I'm sure. Terrified, but sure."

"Good. Because I'm terrified too." He smiled, just a little. "But I'd rather be terrified with you than safe without you."

We swayed to the music while the boardwalk celebrated around us. The Ferris wheel turned overhead, its lights painting patterns on the dark water. Somewhere nearby, Ruby was probably watching with her hand over her heart, thrilled that her romantic hopes for me were finally coming true.

This was it. The moment where I stopped being who everyone else wanted and started being myself. Dancing with the wrong boy at the wrong time in full view of everyone who'd judge.

And it felt more right than anything I'd ever done.

The song ended. Another began. We kept dancing.

"Five days," Finn said eventually. "You have five days to find a place."

"I know. I've been looking. Everything's too expensive."

"What about Mrs. Chen's boarding house? Near the cannery?"

"That's in the north end."

"So?"

"So my mother would die if she knew I was living there."

"Your mother's already dying over your choices. Might as well go all the way." He said it gently, not cruelly. "Mrs. Chen's cheap, clean, and she doesn't ask questions. And it's walking distance to the boardwalk."

"Is that where you live?"

"Next building over. I could show you tomorrow if you want."

Tomorrow. Sunday. The day after I'd told Mother my final decision. The day I'd start actually building this new life instead of just choosing it.

"Okay," I said. "Show me tomorrow."

We danced through three more songs before Walt called me back to work. But as I returned to my counter, as Finn disappeared into the crowd, as the dance continued around me—I felt something I hadn't felt in weeks.

Hope.

Not for an easy future. Not for my mother's approval or society's acceptance.

But hope that maybe, possibly, I could actually do this. Could actually build a life on my own terms. Could actually be brave enough to see it through.

Five days. I had five days to make the impossible possible.

But looking at Finn across the crowded pier, seeing him smile at me like I mattered more than anything—I thought maybe five days would be enough.

It had to be.

Because going back wasn't an option anymore.
