# Chapter 14: The Boardwalk Dance

"Listen up, everyone!" Walt's voice boomed across the arcade Thursday morning. He stood by the prize counter, holding what looked like a flyer. "Got an announcement. The boardwalk's throwing a midsummer dance two weeks from Saturday. Big promotional event—live band, decorations, the whole nine yards. Every attraction will stay open late, and I expect all employees to attend and look presentable. This is good for business, which means it's good for all of us. Questions?"

My stomach dropped.

A dance. In two weeks. Where I'd be expected to attend.

With Martin Fletcher.

While Finn was there somewhere, watching.

"What time's the dance?" someone asked.

"Starts at seven, ends at midnight. Band's from Atlantic City—they're supposed to be first-rate. Morrison's Malt Shop is catering refreshments. We're stringing lights all over the boardwalk, setting up tables on the pier. Should be a real nice evening."

Walt continued with more details, but I'd stopped listening. All I could think about was two weeks from Saturday. Martin escorting me properly, Mother beaming with approval, everyone from Ocean Breeze watching us together.

And Finn, probably working, definitely seeing, knowing exactly what it meant.

"Caroline?" Walt was looking at me. "You alright?"

"Yes. Sorry. Just thinking."

"Well, think about what you're wearing. Something nice but practical—you'll still be helping customers that evening, just in a party atmosphere. Understood?"

I nodded, unable to find words.

That afternoon, Ruby appeared at the arcade with barely contained excitement.

"Did you hear? The boardwalk dance!" She practically vibrated with enthusiasm. "Tommy's coming home on leave that weekend. Perfect timing! I've already started planning my dress—something blue, I think, to match his uniform. What are you going to wear?"

"I don't know. I haven't thought about it."

"You haven't thought about it? Caroline, it's in two weeks! You need time to plan, to find fabric, to—" She stopped, really looking at me. "What's wrong?"

"Martin Fletcher. Mother's already arranged for him to escort me."

"Oh." Ruby's enthusiasm dimmed. "Oh, Caroline."

"And Finn will be there. Working probably, but there. Watching me arrive with Martin and dance with Martin and act like everything's perfectly fine."

Ruby pulled me to a quiet corner of the arcade. "So don't go with Martin."

"How? Mother's already agreed. She's probably already planning my outfit. If I say no, she'll want to know why, and I can't—"

"You can't what? Tell her the truth? That you have feelings for someone else?"

"She already told me to stay away from Finn. If she knows I haven't been listening, if she realizes how much I—" I stopped, the words catching in my throat. "She'll pull me from the job. She'll send me to stay with Aunt Louise until secretary school starts. I'll never see him again."

"And if you go to the dance with Martin? If Finn sees you there, dressed up and smiling and pretending to be happy with someone else? What happens then?"

I didn't have an answer.

Ruby squeezed my hand. "I'm not trying to make this harder. I just want you to think about what you're choosing. Because going to that dance with Martin is a choice. Letting your mother control your life is a choice. Even doing nothing is a choice."

She left to return to the drugstore, and I stood there feeling the weight of two weeks stretching ahead like a deadline I couldn't escape.

That evening, Mother brought up the dance before I could even get through the door.

"Mrs. Henderson mentioned the boardwalk dance! How exciting. Martin will escort you, of course. I've already checked with him and he's delighted." She was sorting through her sewing basket, already planning. "We'll need to make you something special. Nothing too flashy—you want to look respectable, not cheap. I'm thinking a nice cotton dress, maybe that rose pink we saw at the fabric store..."

She kept talking, and I kept nodding, feeling like I was watching my life happen to someone else.

The next day at work, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Two weeks until the dance. Fourteen days to figure out what to do. Or fourteen days to accept that I wasn't brave enough to make a different choice.

Finn appeared at my counter mid-morning, ostensibly to check if any games needed maintenance, but really—I suspected—to talk.

"You heard about the dance?" he asked casually.

"Yes."

"Your mother probably has you going with Martin Fletcher."

"She arranged it already." I couldn't look at him. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It makes sense." His voice was carefully neutral. "He's exactly who you should be seen with. Good family, good job, good prospects."

"Finn—"

"I'm probably not even going. Walt said employees should attend, but he knows I've got other jobs. He'll understand if I skip it."

The thought of him not being there should have been a relief. Instead, it made everything worse.

"You should go," I said. "Walt's right that it's good for business. And you work harder than anyone else here. You deserve to have some fun for once."

"Fun." He said it like the word was foreign. "Yeah, watching you dance with Martin Fletcher sounds like a great time."

"You don't have to watch. You could—" I stopped, because what? Dance with someone else? He didn't have anyone else. "You could just enjoy the music."

Finn leaned against the counter, his expression carefully guarded. "You know what's funny? When I first started working here, I used to watch those summer dances from a distance. All the tourists and south-end kids dancing and laughing, eating ice cream, acting like the boardwalk was their personal playground. I told myself I didn't care. It wasn't my world anyway."

"Finn..."

"But then this summer happened. And you happened. And for a few weeks, I let myself forget that those worlds don't mix. That girls like you don't end up with guys like me."

"That's not fair. You're acting like I have a choice—"

"You do have a choice!" The words came out sharper than he'd probably intended. He took a breath, lowered his voice. "You always have a choice, Caroline. You're just not making it."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me with a counter full of customers and a heart full of guilt.

He was right. I did have choices. I just kept choosing the safe path. The approved path. The path that required nothing of me except obedience.

The next week crept by with agonizing slowness. Mother took me to buy fabric—rose pink, like she'd decided. Ruby showed me sketches of her dress design. Martin called to confirm details, mentioning he'd reserved a table near the band.

And every day at the arcade, Finn and I danced around each other carefully. Still polite. Still friendly. But something had changed. A distance had opened up, and I didn't know how to cross it.

Thursday evening, eight days before the dance, Finn was fixing a loose board on the pier when I found him after closing.

"I don't want to fight," I said. "I hate this tension between us."

"I'm not fighting. I'm just...accepting reality." He hammered the last nail, tested the board. "Summer ends soon anyway. You'll go to secretary school. I'll keep working. We both knew this was temporary."

"It doesn't have to be."

"Doesn't it?" He turned to look at me. "What's the alternative, Caroline? You defy your mother, give up your plans, for what? A summer romance with the maintenance boy? And then what happens when reality hits and you realize you gave up security for someone who can barely afford to feed himself, let alone take care of anyone else?"

"You think that's what I care about? Money and security?"

"I think that's what your mother taught you to care about. And maybe she's right. Maybe that is what matters." He picked up his toolbox. "Go to the dance with Martin. Let him show you off. Let your mother be proud. That's what you're going to do anyway."

"What if I don't want to?"

"But you're going to. Because wanting things and doing things are different." He said it without anger, just sad acceptance. "I learned that a long time ago."

He left me standing on the pier with the sound of waves beneath my feet and eight days stretching ahead like a prison sentence.

That night, I stared at the rose pink fabric draped over my desk chair. Pretty. Appropriate. Exactly what I should wear to a dance with exactly the right kind of boy to make exactly the right kind of impression.

It made me want to scream.

Ruby was right. Going to that dance with Martin was a choice. And every day I didn't do something about it, I was choosing the safe path. The approved path.

The path that led away from everything I actually wanted.

I had eight days to decide if I was brave enough to choose differently.

Eight days to figure out if I valued my mother's approval more than my own happiness.

Eight days to decide what kind of person I wanted to be.

The clock was ticking.

And I still didn't know what I was going to do.
