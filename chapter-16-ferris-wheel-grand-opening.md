# Chapter 16: Ferris Wheel Grand Opening

The invitation arrived by telephone Saturday morning.

Not an invitation for me, exactly. Martin called to inform me that he'd be picking me up at two o'clock for the Ferris wheel grand opening. Walt Morrison had finished renovating the ride—fresh paint, new electrical system, safer cars—and was hosting a celebration with free rides for the first hour.

"Your mother mentioned you'd be available," Martin said, his tone suggesting this was already decided. "It's good business to support the boardwalk, given that's where you work. And the safety upgrades are quite impressive—I've reviewed the engineering reports."

Of course he had.

"I'll be ready at two," I heard myself say.

Mother was thrilled. She'd already picked out my outfit—a yellow sundress with white trim, very summery and appropriate. She talked through breakfast about how important it was to show community support, how Martin was so thoughtful to include me, how this was exactly the kind of proper courtship young people should pursue.

I put on the yellow dress and felt like I was wearing a costume.

Martin arrived precisely at two, driving his gray sedan at exactly the speed limit. He wore a lightweight suit despite the summer heat, and he'd brought a small box of chocolates for Mother.

"For your hospitality, Mrs. Webb." He handed them over with a formal little bow.

Mother practically glowed. This was exactly the kind of young man she'd dreamed of for me—polite, proper, predictable.

The drive to the boardwalk was filled with Martin's lecture on Ferris wheel engineering. "The original wheel was built for the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago," he explained, as if I'd asked. "George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. designed it. Two hundred sixty-four feet tall. People thought it would collapse under its own weight, but Ferris understood load distribution and rotational dynamics..."

I nodded at appropriate moments and watched Ocean Breeze pass by my window. Neat houses giving way to shops and restaurants, then the boardwalk appearing ahead with its fresh paint and carnival atmosphere.

The grand opening was already in full swing. Walt had outdone himself—bunting and streamers in red, white, and blue, a small band playing cheerful music, vendors selling ice cream and cotton candy. Families crowded around the newly painted Ferris wheel, its bright colors gleaming in the afternoon sun.

"Quite a spectacle," Martin said, parking his car with precision. "Though I wonder about the structural integrity of some of these older boardwalk attractions. The wood in particular shows significant wear..."

He kept talking as we walked toward the celebration, but I'd stopped listening. Because across the crowd, near the Ferris wheel's machinery, I spotted Finn.

He was working, of course. Checking the gears, monitoring the ride's operation, ensuring everything ran smoothly. He wore his usual work clothes—old jeans and a gray t-shirt, grease stains on his hands. He looked completely focused on his task, unaware of the celebration happening around him.

Then he looked up.

Our eyes met across probably fifty feet of crowded boardwalk. For a second, everything else disappeared—the music, the crowd noise, Martin's voice droning beside me. There was just Finn, looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Surprise? Sadness? Something more complicated than either.

I felt my chest tighten.

"Caroline?" Martin touched my elbow. "The line for tickets is over here."

I followed him mechanically, but I could still feel Finn's eyes on me. Could still feel the weight of that look, the silent question it contained.

Martin purchased tickets and we joined the line. It moved slowly—lots of families with excited children, couples holding hands, teenagers laughing together. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be here. Everyone except me.

"The statistical risk of Ferris wheel accidents is actually quite low," Martin said, apparently sensing my distraction and misinterpreting its cause. "Approximately one in sixteen million rides results in injury. You're statistically more likely to be injured driving to the boardwalk than riding the wheel itself."

"That's comforting," I managed.

"I thought you'd appreciate knowing. Many people have irrational fears about amusement park rides, but the data clearly shows..." He continued in this vein while the line inched forward.

I looked for Finn again. He was still by the machinery, but now he was deliberately not looking at me. His attention was fixed on the gears, on checking connections, on anything except the line of people waiting to ride.

Anything except me in my yellow dress standing beside Martin Fletcher.

"Next!" The ride operator waved us forward.

Martin helped me into one of the cars with exaggerated care, settling beside me with the kind of proprietary satisfaction that made my skin crawl. The safety bar clicked into place, and the wheel began to turn, lifting us slowly into the air.

"From an engineering perspective," Martin said as we rose, "the Ferris wheel is a beautiful example of rotational equilibrium. Each car acts as a counterweight, you see. As long as the distribution remains balanced..."

I stopped listening. We were rising above the boardwalk now, above the crowd, above the music and the celebration. From up here, I could see the entire scene spread out below. The boardwalk stretching along the coastline. The beach with its scattered umbrellas and sunbathers. The ocean rolling endlessly toward the horizon.

And Finn, standing by the machinery, his face turned up toward our car as we climbed higher.

Even from this distance, even with Martin talking beside me, I felt the connection. Felt Finn watching me like he was trying to memorize this moment. Or say goodbye to it.

My throat went tight.

"The view is rather impressive," Martin acknowledged, following my gaze but looking at the wrong things. "You can see the entire commercial district from up here. Excellent visibility for property value assessment..."

We reached the top of the wheel, and the car swung gently in the breeze. For a moment—just a moment—everything was quiet. The noise of the boardwalk faded, the music became distant, and it was just me and the sky and the ocean stretching forever.

And Finn, far below, still watching.

"Caroline, are you listening?" Martin's voice broke through my thoughts. "I was explaining the property development potential of the north end neighborhoods. With proper investment and urban renewal, those areas could see significant appreciation. Of course, the current residents would likely need to relocate, but that's simply the economics of progress..."

The current residents. People like Finn. People Martin dismissed as easily as discussing quarterly reports.

Something cracked inside me.

I was sitting at the top of a Ferris wheel with a man who saw people as economic statistics. A man who'd never once asked me what I wanted or cared about or dreamed. A man who talked at me for hours without ever actually seeing me.

And below, visible even from up here, was someone who saw me. Who asked me questions and listened to my answers. Who treated his dreams and mine with equal seriousness. Who was everything Martin wasn't, despite—or maybe because of—having nothing Martin had.

"You're quite distracted today," Martin observed. "I hope you're not feeling unwell? The height can affect some people's equilibrium."

"I'm fine," I said automatically.

But I wasn't fine. I was sitting in a car with the wrong person, living the wrong life, following the wrong plan. And from up here, suspended above everything, the truth was so clear it hurt.

I couldn't do this anymore.

I couldn't pretend I wanted this safe, approved, soul-deadening future. Couldn't pretend Martin was anything but exactly what he appeared to be—pleasant and appropriate and utterly devoid of any real connection to me.

Couldn't pretend that watching Finn watch me didn't break something vital inside my chest.

The wheel began descending, carrying us back down to earth, back to reality, back to the life everyone expected me to live. But something had shifted at the top. Some recognition I couldn't un-see.

I had a choice.

Not an easy choice. Not a painless choice. But a choice nonetheless.

I could keep riding this wheel with Martin, around and around, safe and predictable and slowly dying inside.

Or I could get off.

We reached the bottom, and the operator released the safety bar. Martin helped me out with the same careful courtesy he showed everything, and we walked back into the crowd.

"That was quite enjoyable," Martin said. "Perhaps we should get some refreshments? The ice cream vendor over there appears to be serving genuine Italian ices..."

"Martin." I stopped walking. "I need to use the ladies' room. Could you wait here for a moment?"

"Of course. Take your time. I'll be right here." He smiled, perfectly content to wait, perfectly unaware that everything had just changed.

I walked away from him, not toward the restrooms but toward the Ferris wheel machinery. Toward Finn.

I didn't know what I was going to say. Didn't know what I was going to do. I just knew I couldn't stand there with Martin one more second pretending this was what I wanted.

Couldn't spend one more moment living a lie when the truth was standing twenty feet away, watching me with dark eyes that saw everything.

My heart hammered as I crossed the boardwalk.

This was it. The moment I stopped being passive, stopped letting life happen to me, stopped following everyone else's script.

The moment I started writing my own story.

Even if I had no idea how that story would end.
