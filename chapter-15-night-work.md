# Chapter 15: Night Work

Friday evening, Walt asked me to stay late for inventory. Summer stock was running low on certain prizes, and he needed an accurate count before placing his next order.

"Should only take an hour," he said. "You'll be paid overtime, of course."

Mother wasn't happy about the late night, but she couldn't argue with overtime pay. She agreed to pick me up at nine instead of eight.

I worked through the inventory systematically, counting and recording. Stuffed animals, paddle balls, toy cars, candy. The arcade emptied around me, the sounds of games fading to silence as Walt closed up the main floor. By eight-thirty, it was just me in the back room with clipboards and boxes.

I'd just finished the count when I heard Walt's voice from the main floor.

"Finn? What are you still doing here?"

"Noticed the boardwalk railing by the south entrance has a loose section. Thought I'd fix it before someone gets hurt."

"At this hour? Son, you work too hard."

"Rather fix it now than have someone fall through tomorrow." A pause. "Caroline still here?"

"In the back doing inventory. Should be done soon."

My heart picked up speed.

"I'll get out of your way then."

"Finn." Walt's voice was gentle. "You know you don't have to avoid her. Whatever's going on between you two, it's okay to talk to each other."

"There's nothing going on. She's got her life planned out. I'm just... working."

"If you say so." Walt sounded unconvinced. "I'm heading home. Lock up when you're done with that railing, and make sure Caroline gets to her car safely."

"Yes, sir."

The front door closed. I heard Walt's car start and drive away. Then silence, except for the ocean and the creak of floorboards as Finn moved around the darkening boardwalk.

I finished my inventory sheets and put the clipboards in Walt's office. Then, instead of waiting by the front for Mother, I found myself walking out the back door onto the boardwalk.

The sun had set, leaving the sky that deep blue between day and night. The boardwalk lights were coming on, stringing golden glow across the weathered wood. Most of the crowd had dispersed, leaving just a few couples strolling and families heading home after dinner.

I found Finn at the south entrance, exactly where he'd said he'd be. He was working on a section of railing where the wood had started to separate from the support posts. His work light cast harsh shadows, and his toolbox sat open beside him.

He looked up when he heard my footsteps, surprised. "I thought you'd wait inside for your mother."

"I have a few minutes. Thought I'd see what you're working on."

"Loose railing. Someone leans on this wrong, they're going through and falling eight feet to the sand." He demonstrated how the wood shifted. "Needs new bolts and a reinforcement bracket."

"You're fixing it at night. After a full day of work."

"Can't fix it during the day. Too many people using the boardwalk." He returned to his work, drilling a new hole for a longer bolt. "This is when maintenance happens. When nobody's looking."

I leaned against a stable section of railing, watching him work. The ocean rolled beneath us, dark and vast. Above, stars were starting to appear.

"Finn, about what you said earlier this week. About me always choosing the safe path—"

"Forget it. I was out of line."

"No, you were right. I do keep choosing safety over what I want. I keep letting other people decide things for me because it's easier than fighting."

He set down his drill and looked at me. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I'm tired of it. Tired of being someone else's idea of who I should be. Tired of following plans I never made." I took a breath. "And I'm tired of pretending I don't have feelings for you when I very clearly do."

Finn went very still. "Caroline..."

"I know it's complicated. I know my mother would lose her mind. I know we don't make sense on paper. But I'm tired of only doing things that make sense on paper."

"What about the dance? Martin Fletcher? Your mother's approval?"

"I don't know. I'm still figuring that out. But I know I don't want to keep avoiding you and pretending we're just coworkers. I know that every time you walk away, I feel like I'm losing something important."

Finn was quiet for a long moment, his dark eyes searching my face. Then he set down his tools and stood, moving closer but not quite touching me.

"Do you know why I work so much?" he asked quietly. "All these jobs, all these hours?"

"To help your family. To save money."

"That's part of it. But there's more." He looked out at the dark ocean. "Every dollar I save, every skill I learn, every book I read at the library—I'm building something. Not just saving for night school, though that's the goal. I'm building proof. Proof that I'm more than what people see when they look at me. More than just the maintenance boy from the north end."

"You don't have to prove anything—"

"Yes, I do. Because that's the only way someone like me gets out. We don't get handed opportunities. We have to build them from nothing, piece by piece, hour by hour." He turned back to me. "And you want to know what's been driving me crazy? What keeps me working until midnight even when I'm exhausted?"

I nodded.

"You. The idea of you." His voice was rough with emotion. "The idea that maybe, somehow, if I work hard enough and save enough and become enough, I might actually deserve someone like you. That I might be able to offer you something real instead of just... whatever this is."

"Finn, I don't need you to be anything other than what you are."

"But what am I?" The question came out almost desperate. "A kid with two years of high school and twenty-three dollars in savings. I fix broken things for minimum wage. I can barely afford to buy you ice cream, let alone take you to a proper dinner or a movie or any of the things Martin Fletcher can offer."

"I don't want Martin Fletcher. I want—" I stopped, suddenly aware that we were standing very close, his eyes on mine, the space between us charged with everything unsaid. "I want this. You. Us talking about things that matter. I want someone who sees me, really sees me, not just who I'm supposed to be."

"I do see you." His hand lifted, hesitated, then gently touched my face. "I see someone brave enough to question the life everyone else planned for her. Someone kind enough to care about other people's dreams. Someone who makes me believe that maybe impossible things aren't actually impossible."

His thumb brushed my cheek, and I forgot how to breathe.

"Caroline, if you choose this—if you choose me—it won't be easy. Your mother will fight you. People will judge. And I can't promise you security or stability or any of the things you're supposed to want."

"What can you promise?"

"That I'll always see you. That I'll never ask you to be someone you're not. That I'll work as hard as I can to build a future worth having." His voice dropped to barely a whisper. "And that I'm falling for you, even though I know I shouldn't. Even though it terrifies me."

"I'm falling too," I whispered back. "And I'm terrified."

"Good. At least we're terrified together."

We stood there in the lamplight, his hand on my face, mine resting on his arm, the ocean crashing beneath us. Not kissing, not yet—that felt like a line neither of us was quite ready to cross. But connected. Honest. Real.

"I should finish this railing," Finn said eventually, though he didn't move.

"And my mother will be here soon."

"Probably." His hand dropped away slowly, reluctantly. "Caroline? Whatever you decide about the dance, about Martin, about all of it—I understand. I won't make it harder than it already is."

"What if I want you to make it harder? What if I need someone to fight for me?"

"I will. If you want me to." He picked up his drill again. "But this has to be your choice. Not your mother's, not mine. Yours."

I nodded, even though the weight of that choice felt overwhelming.

I stayed while he finished reinforcing the railing, neither of us talking much but both aware of the other's presence. When headlights appeared in the parking lot—Mother, punctual as always—Finn walked me to the edge of the boardwalk.

"Goodnight, Caroline."

"Goodnight."

I walked to Mother's car, and she immediately started asking about the inventory and whether Walt had paid me for overtime. I answered automatically, but my mind was back on the boardwalk with Finn and his work light and his rough hands gentle on my face.

He was falling for me.

I was falling for him.

And in one week, I'd have to face the dance, face Martin, face everyone's expectations.

But for tonight, I had this. The memory of standing close to Finn while he told me the truth. The knowledge that whatever I chose, it would be my choice.

The certainty that I mattered to him, and he mattered to me, and that was real in a way nothing else in my life had ever been.

As Mother drove us home, still chattering about fabrics and proper behavior, I touched my cheek where Finn's hand had been and let myself feel something dangerous.

Hope.

Not for the future everyone else wanted for me.

For the future I might be brave enough to choose for myself.
