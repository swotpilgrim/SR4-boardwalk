# Chapter 25: Finding Each Other

By seven o'clock, the boardwalk was packed.

Families spread across every available surface—blankets on the beach, chairs on the pier, children perched on parents' shoulders to get a better view. The smell of hot dogs and cotton candy mixed with salt air. Someone's transistor radio played patriotic music. Everywhere, red, white, and blue.

I'd been working since eight that morning and my feet ached, my voice was hoarse, and I'd lost count of how many tokens I'd sold. But the day had been good—busy enough that tips added up, festive enough that even difficult customers seemed cheerful.

Walt had closed the arcade at six to give everyone time to enjoy the fireworks. Now I was stationed near the pier entrance, helping direct foot traffic and making sure people didn't crowd too close to the launch area.

The sun set in shades of orange and pink, painting the ocean like a postcard. As twilight deepened, anticipation built. Children asking "When will they start?" Parents checking watches. The band finishing their final song before the main event.

I looked for Finn in the crowd but couldn't find him. He was somewhere checking equipment, making sure everything was safe and functional. Doing the invisible work that made celebrations possible.

Then I spotted him near the Ferris wheel, talking to Walt. Even from a distance, even in the fading light, I recognized the way he moved, the slope of his shoulders, the gesture of his hands when he explained something.

He looked up, scanning the crowd, and found me.

Our eyes met across probably a hundred people, and something passed between us. Not words. Just recognition. Just connection.

Just certainty.

The crowd pressed between us, but Finn started making his way through. Slowly, carefully, navigating the mass of people waiting for fireworks.

I stayed where I was, watching him come. Watching him choose to cross that distance. Watching him smile as he got closer—that real smile I'd worked so hard to earn.

"Hey," he said when he finally reached me. "Busy day?"

"Exhausting day. Good day."

"Same." He stood close but didn't touch—we were still in public, still visible to everyone. "You look tired."

"I am tired. But happy tired." I glanced at the families around us. "Is everything ready? For the fireworks?"

"Everything's perfect. Walt's been planning this for months. It's going to be spectacular."

"When do they start?"

"Ten minutes. Maybe fifteen." He looked around, then back at me. "Want to watch from somewhere less crowded? I know a spot."

"I'm supposed to stay here. Crowd management."

"Walt said you could have a break once the fireworks started. I already checked." Finn held out his hand. "Come on. Trust me."

I took his hand, and we slipped away from the main crowd. Finn led me down the pier, past the vendors and the families, to a section near the end that was roped off for safety. He ducked under the rope, pulling me after him.

"Finn, we're not supposed to be here—"

"I helped set up the safety barriers. I know where we can stand without being in the way." He positioned us at the very end of the pier, where the ocean stretched dark and endless beneath us. "See? Perfect view, no crowds."

He was right. From here, we could see the entire launch area, the beach packed with spectators, the boardwalk lit up like a carnival. But we were separate from it. In our own bubble of privacy while surrounded by celebration.

"How did you know about this spot?"

"I've worked this boardwalk for three years. I know all the good hiding places." He kept hold of my hand, his thumb tracing familiar circles on my palm. "Plus, I wanted to ask you something without an audience."

My heart sped up. "What?"

Finn turned to face me fully, his expression serious in the fading light. Behind him, the ocean rolled endlessly, and I could hear the crowd's anticipation building like a wave about to break.

"Are you happy? Really happy?" he asked. "Not just making the best of a difficult situation, not just surviving, but actually happy with how things are?"

The question hung between us, weighted with everything we'd both risked to get here. I took a moment to really think about it instead of just giving the answer I thought he wanted to hear.

The question caught me off guard. I thought about my tiny room at Mrs. Chen's. About rice and beans for dinner most nights. About the stress of making rent every week, the exhaustion of working two jobs, the loneliness of being cut off from Mother.

And then I thought about waking up in a space that was mine. About choosing how to spend my days. About conversations with Finn that actually mattered. About the strange freedom of having very little but knowing it was all earned by me.

"Yes," I said. "I'm happy. Scared and stressed and tired, but happy."

"Even though it's hard?"

"Especially because it's hard. Because it's mine." I squeezed his hand. "Why are you asking?"

"Because I need to know you're not regretting it. That you're not wishing you'd chosen differently."

"I'm not. Are you?"

"Regretting you?" Finn pulled me closer. "Never. I'm just constantly terrified you're going to wake up one day and realize you could have had an easier life."

"Easier isn't always better."

"No. But it's tempting when you're eating beans for the fifth night in a row."

"Then we'll get creative with beans." I smiled. "Finn, stop worrying that I'm going to change my mind. I'm here. I'm staying. Get used to it."

"I'm trying. It's just—" He stopped, looking out at the ocean. "I've never had anything this good before. And I keep waiting for it to fall apart."

"What if it doesn't? What if we actually make it work?"

"Then I'll be the luckiest guy in Ocean Breeze." He looked back at me. "I meant what I said the other night. I love you, Caroline. Even though it's impractical and financially irresponsible and probably too soon."

"I love you too. Even though you're stubborn and overly protective and terrible at accepting that good things can happen to you."

He laughed, and the sound was warm and real and full of relief. "We're a mess."

"We're figuring it out."

"Yeah. We are." He touched my face gently. "I enrolled in night classes. Start in September. Two classes to begin with—mathematics and introductory engineering. I went to the community college office yesterday, filled out all the forms, handed over my first tuition payment." He said it like he still couldn't quite believe it was real. "Twenty-three dollars I've been saving for three years, plus another fifteen I scraped together last month. It's only enough for two classes, but it's a start."

"Finn, that's wonderful!" I felt tears prick my eyes. "You're really doing it. You're actually going to become an engineer."

"I'm going to try. It's going to be brutal—working full time during the day, classes three nights a week, studying whenever I can find time. Probably failing at everything for a while before I figure out how to balance it all." But he was smiling wider than I'd ever seen. "But I'm doing it. Actually doing it instead of just dreaming about it."

"Because you're brave enough now."

"Because you showed me how." He leaned his forehead against mine. "We're both doing impossible things. We might as well do them together."

A sound echoed across the water—the band playing the opening notes of the national anthem. The crowd on the beach stood, hands over hearts. The moment before celebration.

Finn and I stood at the end of the pier, his arms around me, and waited for the sky to explode with light.

"Thank you," I whispered.

"For what?"

"For seeing me. For asking what I wanted. For being brave enough to want something impossible."

"Thank you for choosing yourself. Even though it meant I got to benefit from that choice."

The anthem ended. A moment of held breath. Then the first rocket screamed into the sky.

The firework exploded overhead—red and gold and brilliant. The crowd on the beach roared with appreciation. More fireworks followed, painting the night in impossible colors.

Finn held me close while the sky ignited above us, while the ocean reflected the colors, while the boardwalk erupted in celebration.

And I thought about how far I'd come. From the girl who followed every rule, to someone brave enough to write her own story. From playing it safe, to risking everything. From living half a life, to choosing to be fully, terrifyingly alive.

It wasn't easy. It wasn't what anyone had planned for me.

But standing here with Finn, with fireworks painting the sky and my future uncertain but mine—I'd never felt more certain that I'd chosen right.

The fireworks continued, each one more spectacular than the last. Building toward some grand finale we couldn't yet see but were willing to wait for.

Just like our lives. Building toward something we couldn't quite see but were brave enough to reach for anyway.

Together.
