# Chapter 4: Watching Him Work

I didn't apologize the next day. Or the day after that. Every time I saw Finn—and I saw him more often than I'd expected, now that I was looking—the words stuck in my throat. What would I even say? "Sorry I was rude when you were fixing the machine I couldn't fix myself"? It sounded hollow even in my head.

So instead, I watched.

Once I started paying attention, I saw Finn everywhere. Tuesday morning, replacing burned-out bulbs in the arcade sign. Tuesday afternoon, repainting railings near the Ferris wheel, his shirt speckled with white paint. Wednesday, fixing the carousel's music mechanism while tinny waltz music stuttered and stopped.

He never stopped moving. Never took breaks like the other workers—gathering to smoke cigarettes and complain about tourists, or disappearing for long lunches. Finn just worked, one task flowing into the next, his toolbox always within reach.

And people looked right through him.

I noticed that too, once I started watching. The way tourists stepped around him without acknowledgment, as if he were a piece of boardwalk furniture. The way teenagers from the south end—kids I recognized from church, from Mother's social circle—walked past him without a glance, then clustered together laughing about something, their voices carrying back over the sound of the waves.

Thursday afternoon, I watched a well-dressed woman in a yellow sundress march up to the bench where Finn was working. He'd dismantled part of the bench's back support and was replacing rotted wood with fresh boards. His tools were spread on a tarp beside him, and he was focused on measuring the new board to fit.

"Excuse me," the woman said, her voice sharp with irritation. "How long is this going to take? I wanted to sit here."

Finn looked up. "About ten more minutes, ma'am."

"Well, that's very inconvenient. There are other benches, you know. Why did you have to choose this one right now?"

Because the wood is rotted, I thought. Because if he doesn't fix it, someone will sit down and the bench will collapse and then you'll complain about that instead.

But Finn just said, "Sorry for the inconvenience," and moved his toolbox slightly to the side, even though he was still clearly using it.

The woman huffed and walked away, muttering about poor planning and inconsiderate workers.

Finn returned to his measuring like nothing had happened. Like he was used to it.

I felt something uncomfortable shift in my chest. That woman had treated him like he was deliberately trying to inconvenience her, when he was literally repairing the very bench she wanted to use. And Finn had apologized. For doing his job. For being in her way while fixing something she'd have complained about if it broke.

How many times had people done that to him? How many times had he been treated like an obstacle instead of a person?

How many times had I done exactly the same thing?

Friday morning, another machine broke down. The claw machine this time—the mechanism that controlled the claw's grip had stopped working, so even when children positioned it perfectly, the claw wouldn't close. Three kids had already lost their tokens, and their parents were starting to demand refunds I wasn't authorized to give.

I needed Finn's help again.

This time, I didn't wave him down or call across the arcade. I walked over to where he was working on a pinball machine near the back wall and waited until he looked up.

"I'm sorry to interrupt," I said, keeping my voice level. "The claw machine isn't working. The grip mechanism, I think. When you have a moment, could you take a look?"

Finn studied me for a second, his expression unreadable. Then he nodded. "Give me five minutes to finish this."

"Thank you. There's no rush." There was a rush, actually—the parents were getting more annoyed by the minute—but I said it anyway.

Finn arrived at the claw machine exactly five minutes later. He opened the service panel, examined the mechanism, and pulled out a small screwdriver from his toolbox.

"It's a tension spring," he said, not looking at me. "Slipped off the grip lever. Happens sometimes with the cheap machines."

I watched him work, his hands quick and sure, adjusting something I couldn't quite see. Within three minutes, the claw was gripping and releasing smoothly again.

"That should do it," he said, closing the panel.

"Thank you," I said. And then, before I could stop myself, "I'm sorry. About Monday. I was rude."

Finn's hand stilled on his toolbox. He looked at me then, really looked, like he was trying to figure out if I meant it.

"You were stressed," he said finally. "People get stressed."

"That's not an excuse."

Something flickered in his expression—not quite a smile, but not the cold distance either. "No," he agreed. "It's not."

He picked up his toolbox and walked away, but this time it felt different. Not like he was dismissing me. Just like the conversation was over, and he had other work to do.

I returned to my counter feeling like I'd managed to fix something more important than a claw machine.

The rest of Friday passed in the usual chaos of tokens and prizes and children arguing over how many tickets they had. But I found myself watching Finn's progress around the boardwalk. Saw him fix a broken spoke on the Ferris wheel. Watched him help an elderly couple figure out why their car wouldn't start in the parking lot. Noticed him pause to give directions to a lost family, pointing them toward the beach access.

He was everywhere, doing everything, and almost nobody noticed.

Saturday morning, Walt called me into his office before opening.

"You settling in alright?" he asked, leaning back in his chair.

"Yes, sir. I mean, yes, Walt."

He smiled at that. "You're doing good work, Caroline. Till's been perfect every night, customers seem to like you, and you're learning fast." He paused. "Had a good apprentice once who learned fast like you. Worked here for three summers before I offered him a partnership."

I wasn't sure what to say to that. "Thank you?"

"Point is, some people see this place as a summer job, easy money, something to do before real life starts. And that's fine. But some people see it different. See the work that goes into keeping everything running. The skill it takes." He looked at me steadily. "I'm thinking maybe you're starting to see it that way."

My face warmed. "I didn't understand. Before. How much work Finn does. How skilled he is."

"Most people don't. They see a kid with a toolbox, think anybody could do what he does. But Finn's got a gift for how things work. Never seen anyone pick up mechanical systems so fast. He understands the why behind the how, if that makes sense."

"It does."

Walt nodded. "Good. Now get out there. Saturday's our biggest day, and we've got tour buses coming in from Philadelphia."

The Saturday rush made Monday's jam look tame. By noon, every attraction was packed, and I was selling tokens as fast as I could make change. The noise was incredible—screaming children, ringing bells, pop music mixing with carousel organs.

In the middle of it all, I caught glimpses of Finn. Fixing a stuck turnstile. Unjamming the shooting gallery. Helping a crying child whose balloon had tangled in the rafters—he climbed a ladder, freed it carefully, and tied it securely to the child's wrist.

Nobody thanked him for the balloon rescue except the child's mother. Nobody seemed to notice when he fixed the turnstile that three families had been complaining about. He was just part of the background, like the painted signs and the string lights, noticed only when something went wrong.

By the time eight o'clock came and Walt flipped the closed sign, I was so exhausted I could barely count my till. My voice was gone from shouting over the noise all day. My feet throbbed. My head ached from the constant sensory assault.

I saw Finn leaving through the back door, toolbox in hand, and wondered how many more jobs he was heading to. How many more hours he'd work before he finally stopped for the day.

The whole drive home, Mother talked about church socials and the fabric she'd found for my new school skirts and whether I'd heard from Martin Fletcher yet about the Fourth of July concert. I made appropriate responses, but my mind was somewhere else.

I was thinking about what Walt had said. About seeing the work, understanding the skill, recognizing what went into keeping things running.

I was thinking about Finn climbing that ladder to rescue a child's balloon, his face patient and kind, the same expression I'd seen when he'd helped that little boy at skee-ball on my first day.

I was thinking about all the times I'd walked past people without really seeing them. The ticket seller. The ride operators. The woman who cleaned our church on Fridays. The man who delivered our milk. All the people who did necessary work that made life run smoothly, and how I'd never really thought about them as people with their own lives and dreams and complications.

Mother had taught me to be polite to service workers. To say please and thank you. To treat them with appropriate courtesy.

But courtesy wasn't the same as actually seeing someone. Actually acknowledging that they existed beyond the function they performed for you.

That night, I added my week's earnings to the cigar box under my bed. Forty dollars total now, plus tips. Two hundred sixty to go. But as I tucked the money away and closed the lid, I found myself wondering something I'd never wondered before.

What was Finn saving for? He worked constantly, took every job he could get. Where did his money go? Did he have a plan like mine? Or was his situation different—more complicated than just saving for a future he'd already chosen?

The thought stayed with me as I got ready for bed, even as I tried to focus on my own goals, my own path, my own carefully laid plans.

I'd spent three weeks at the boardwalk now, and I was supposed to be learning about work, about responsibility, about earning my future.

But maybe I was learning something else entirely.

Maybe I was learning how to actually see the world around me instead of just looking at it through the lens of what I'd been taught to notice.

And maybe—just maybe—that was more important than any amount of money I could save.
