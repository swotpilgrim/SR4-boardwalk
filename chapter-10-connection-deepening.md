# Chapter 10: Connection Deepening

After Mother's warning, I tried to keep my distance. Really, I did.

But the arcade was small, and Finn worked everywhere, and avoiding him completely was impossible. So I settled for being polite but distant. No more lemonade. No more seeking him out for conversations. Just professional courtesy when our paths crossed.

It lasted exactly three days.

Late Friday afternoon, Walt asked me to reorganize the top prize shelf. We'd gotten a new shipment of stuffed animals, and he wanted the bigger ones displayed higher up where kids could see them.

"Use the stepladder in the back room," he said. "And be careful. That shelf is higher than it looks."

The stepladder was old, slightly wobbly, but it seemed sturdy enough. I set it up beneath the prize display and climbed carefully, my arms full of stuffed elephants and bears.

The top shelf was indeed higher than it looked. I had to stretch to reach it properly, standing on my toes even on the ladder's highest step. I placed the first elephant carefully, then reached for the second.

That's when the ladder shifted.

It wasn't much—just a slight wobble as my weight redistributed. But it was enough to make me lose my balance, enough to make my heart leap into my throat, enough to make me realize I was about to fall.

Then hands were there, steady and sure, gripping the ladder's sides and holding it stable.

"Careful." Finn's voice came from directly below me, quiet but firm.

I looked down and found him steadying the ladder, his hands braced on either side of my legs, his face tilted up toward mine. Our eyes met, and something electric passed between us.

"The ladder's uneven," he said. "One of the feet isn't locked properly. Don't move—let me fix it."

He adjusted something at the base of the ladder, his movements careful while keeping the whole thing steady. Then he tested it, making sure it was solid before stepping back.

"Okay. It's stable now. But take it slow."

My heart was still racing, though I wasn't sure anymore if it was from the near-fall or from the way Finn was watching me with such careful attention.

I placed the second elephant on the shelf, then reached for the third. Still a stretch. I rose up on my toes again, reaching, almost there—

The stuffed bear slipped from my grip. I lunged to catch it, forgot about my balance, and felt myself tip backward.

Finn caught me.

His hands found my waist, steadying me, holding on while I clutched the ladder's top for dear life. For a moment we both froze—me gripping the ladder, him holding me stable, neither quite believing what had just happened.

"I've got you," he said quietly. "You're okay."

My hands were shaking. "I almost fell."

"But you didn't. Come down. I'll get the bears."

"I can finish—"

"Caroline." He said my name softly, but there was something underneath it. Concern maybe, or fear that I'd almost gotten hurt. "Come down. Please."

I climbed down carefully, Finn's hands staying on my waist to steady me until my feet touched solid ground. But even after I was safe, neither of us moved. We were standing very close, his hands still resting lightly at my waist, my hands on his arms for balance.

This close, I could see the flecks of gold in his dark eyes. Could see the faint line of an old scar on his chin. Could feel the warmth radiating from him in the stuffy arcade air.

"Thank you," I managed, my voice coming out softer than intended.

"You scared me." His hands tightened slightly at my waist, barely perceptible. "When you started to fall, I—" He stopped, seemed to realize what he was saying, what we were doing, how close we were standing.

He stepped back, his hands falling away, leaving me feeling strangely cold despite the summer heat.

"Sorry. I shouldn't have—" He ran a hand through his hair, looking flustered in a way I'd never seen him before. "I'll get those bears."

He climbed the ladder while I stood there trying to remember how to breathe normally. My waist still felt warm where his hands had been. My pulse was still racing. And I couldn't stop watching him work—the careful way he placed each stuffed animal, making sure they were secure, checking twice that everything was stable.

When he came back down, he examined the ladder carefully.

"This foot lock is stripped. Walt should replace this before someone gets hurt." He looked at me. "You okay?"

"I'm fine. Thanks to you."

"Yeah, well." He picked up his toolbox. "I should get back to work."

"Finn, wait."

He turned back, his expression guarded.

"I haven't been avoiding you these past few days," I lied. "I've just been busy."

"Sure." He clearly didn't believe me. "It's fine, Caroline. Your mother probably told you to stay away from the maintenance boy. I get it."

"That's not—" I stopped, because it was exactly that, and we both knew it. "She doesn't understand. She thinks you're just some summer job, some distraction from my plans. She doesn't know you."

"She's right to worry." Finn's voice was flat. "I am a distraction. You should be focused on secretarial school, on your future. Not wasting time talking to me about bridges and engineering books."

"It's not a waste of time."

"Isn't it?" He looked at me steadily. "What future does this have, Caroline? You and me being friends, or whatever this is? Summer ends in six weeks. You go to secretary school. I keep working maintenance. We both knew this was temporary."

The words hurt more than they should have. "So what, we just stop talking? Pretend we don't—" I stopped myself before I said something I couldn't take back.

"Pretend we don't what?"

The question hung between us, heavy with meaning. Finn watched me, waiting for an answer I wasn't brave enough to give.

"Nothing," I said finally. "Never mind."

"That's what I thought." He picked up his toolbox again, but he didn't leave immediately. Instead he stood there, seeming to wrestle with something. Finally he said, "For what it's worth? These past few weeks have been the best part of my summer. Maybe the best part of the whole year. Talking to you, I mean. About real things. Stuff that matters."

"Then why are you acting like we should stop?"

"Because you have a future planned, and I'm not part of it. Because your mother is right—getting attached to each other is just going to make it hurt more when summer ends." He met my eyes. "And because when you almost fell just now, I realized I'm already attached. More than I should be."

My breath caught. "Finn—"

"Don't." He said it gently but firmly. "Don't say anything you'll regret later. Don't make promises we both know you can't keep. Your life is planned out, Caroline. Mine is scrambling to survive. Those don't fit together, no matter how much we might want them to."

He walked away then, heading toward the back of the arcade, leaving me standing beside the wobbly stepladder with my heart doing complicated things in my chest.

He was attached. More than he should be.

Which meant he felt it too. This pull between us. This connection that had grown from hostility into friendship into something neither of us quite knew how to name.

And he was trying to protect us both by walking away.

But what if I didn't want protection? What if I wanted to see where this connection led, consequences be damned?

I finished organizing the prize shelf on my own, moving the stepladder carefully and checking it twice before climbing. The work gave me time to think, and thinking gave me clarity.

Finn was right that we came from different worlds. Right that my mother would never approve. Right that summer was temporary and our paths were supposed to diverge come September.

But he was wrong about one thing: I did have a choice. Maybe not about everything, but about this. About whether I let fear of the future ruin what was happening right now.

That evening, as the arcade was closing, I found Finn by the back door. He was putting away his tools, getting ready to leave for whatever job came next.

"Finn."

He looked up, wary.

"I understand what you're saying. About summer being temporary and our lives not fitting together. I understand all of that." I took a breath. "But I don't care."

"You should care. Your mother—"

"Can make her opinion known, but she can't control how I feel." The words came out stronger than I expected. "And I feel like these conversations with you are the only real thing in my life right now. Everything else is just following scripts and meeting expectations. But with you, I'm actually myself. Do you know how rare that is?"

Finn studied me carefully. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I don't want to avoid you because it's practical or safe or what someone else thinks I should do. I'm saying these past three days without talking to you have been miserable, and I don't want to do that anymore." I moved closer. "I'm saying I don't care that summer's temporary. I care about right now."

For a long moment, Finn didn't respond. Then slowly, carefully, he reached out and took my hand.

His palm was warm, calloused from years of work. His fingers curled around mine, gentle but sure. It was just a hand-hold, nothing more, but it felt significant. Real. Like we were making a choice together instead of letting circumstances choose for us.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Right now, then. We'll figure out the rest later."

"Right now," I agreed.

We stood there in the back hallway of the arcade, holding hands while the ocean crashed outside and the boardwalk hummed with evening crowds. Not kissing, not even embracing. Just connected. Just acknowledging that whatever this was between us, it mattered.

It mattered enough to be brave for.

Eventually we had to let go—I had to finish closing up, and Finn had another job waiting. But as he left, he looked back at me with something in his eyes that made my heart race.

Not just attachment. Something deeper than that.

Something that felt like the beginning of falling.

And for the first time, instead of being terrified by that feeling, I decided to let myself fall.

Whatever happened come September, at least I'd have this summer. At least I'd have chosen something for myself.

At least I'd know what it felt like to be seen, really seen, by someone who mattered.

That had to be worth the risk.
