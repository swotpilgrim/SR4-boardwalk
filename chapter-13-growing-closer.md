# Chapter 13: Growing Closer

Wednesday afternoon brought a crisis that turned into something else entirely.

The new claw machine—Walt's pride and joy, installed just last week—stopped working right in the middle of peak hours. Not just a simple jam. The entire mechanism had seized up, the claw frozen mid-air, a stuffed elephant trapped in its grip while three children cried and their parents demanded refunds.

"Finn!" I called across the arcade. "The claw machine's completely dead!"

He appeared within seconds, took one look at the frozen mechanism, and frowned. "That's not good. This is going to take a while. It's probably the main gear assembly."

"How long?"

"Could be an hour. Maybe more." He glanced at the growing crowd of disappointed customers. "Tell Walt I'll have to take it apart. And I'm going to need help."

"I'll get someone—"

"No, I need you. Someone who knows how the prize system works, what parts go where. Can you spare an hour?"

Walt agreed immediately. "Jerry can cover the counter. Go help Finn. That machine cost me two hundred dollars—I want it fixed right."

So I found myself kneeling on the arcade floor beside Finn while he systematically dismantled the claw machine. He'd spread a drop cloth beneath it and laid out his tools in careful order.

"Here's how this works," he said, removing the access panel. "I'm going to hand you parts. You need to remember exactly what order they come out in, because they have to go back in the exact same order. Can you do that?"

"I think so."

"Don't think. Know. If we mess this up, the whole thing's useless."

His seriousness focused me. "I can do it."

"Good. Ready?"

For the next hour, I watched Finn work with complete concentration. He'd remove a part, explain what it was and why it mattered, then hand it to me carefully. I arranged everything on the drop cloth in order, paying attention to orientation, to how things fit together, to the logic of the mechanism.

"This is the main drive gear," Finn said, holding up a metal wheel with intricate teeth. "See how it's supposed to mesh with this smaller gear here? Something got jammed in between—probably a piece of broken plastic from one of the prizes. When the gears tried to turn, they seized instead of meshing."

He showed me the tiny piece of purple plastic wedged between two gear teeth. Such a small thing to stop an entire machine.

"So you just remove it?"

"Not just. I need to check that it didn't damage the teeth. If the gears are stripped, I'll have to order new ones and the machine's down for a week." He examined both gears carefully under the work light he'd set up. "We got lucky. No damage. Just needs cleaning and re-lubrication."

"How did you learn all this?"

"Trial and error mostly. Breaking things, fixing them, figuring out why they work." He glanced at me. "Hand me that small brush, would you? The wire one."

I found it in his toolbox and passed it over. Our fingers brushed in the exchange, and I felt that now-familiar jolt of awareness.

Finn felt it too—I could tell by the way he paused for just a second before taking the brush and returning to his work.

"When I was a kid," he said, cleaning the gears methodically, "I used to take apart my mother's kitchen radio. Drive her crazy. But I always put it back together—eventually. Took me six tries the first time."

"Is that when you knew you wanted to be an engineer?"

"I didn't know it was called engineering then. I just knew I liked understanding how things worked." He set down the brush and started applying lubricant. "First time I saw a blueprint at the library—I was maybe thirteen. Those drawings, all those precise lines and calculations—it was like seeing music written down. Like suddenly there was a language for what I'd been trying to figure out on my own."

The passion in his voice made my chest ache. "You talk about it like it's art."

"It is art. Just with math and physics instead of paint." He looked at me, his expression earnest. "People think engineering is all cold calculations, but it's not. It's about vision. About seeing something that doesn't exist yet and figuring out how to make it real. That's as creative as any painting."

"Then you should do it. You should find a way."

"Twenty-three dollars, Caroline. That's how much I've saved in three years. At this rate, I'll be able to afford one semester of community college when I'm forty."

"So we'll figure something else out. Scholarships, or loans, or—"

"We?" He said it gently, but there was a question underneath.

I realized what I'd said. We. Like this was something we were doing together. Like his dreams were my dreams too.

"I just mean there have to be options. Ways to make it work."

Finn was quiet for a moment, fitting the gears back together with careful precision. Then he said, "Why do you care so much? About what I want, I mean. You've got your own future to worry about."

"Because when you talk about engineering, you light up. Like you're more yourself than any other time. And that matters."

"Why does it matter?"

"Because you matter." The words came out before I could stop them. "To me, I mean. You matter to me."

Finn's hands stilled on the gears. He looked up at me, and something in his expression made my breath catch.

"You matter to me too," he said quietly. "More than you probably should."

We stayed like that, kneeling on the arcade floor surrounded by mechanical parts and tools, looking at each other while the noise of the arcade faded into background static. The moment stretched, heavy with things neither of us was quite brave enough to say.

Then a child ran past, bumping into Finn's toolbox, and the spell broke.

"Come on," Finn said, his voice slightly rough. "Let's get this thing put back together."

We worked in comfortable silence after that, Finn reinstalling parts while I handed them to him in reverse order, both of us careful not to let our hands touch again. The casual intimacy of working together, of moving in sync, understanding what the other needed without having to ask—it felt significant somehow. Like we were building something more than just fixing a machine.

"There," Finn said finally, securing the last screw. "Let's test it."

He powered on the machine. The claw moved smoothly through its programmed sequence. Down, grip, up, release. Perfect.

"You did it," I said.

"We did it." He started gathering his tools. "You were a good assistant. Paid attention, remembered things. Most people can't do that."

"Most people don't have a teacher as patient as you."

Finn smiled—a real one, warm and genuine. "Yeah, well. I had good motivation to make sure you understood."

We stood up, brushing off our clothes. I had grease on my hands, dust on my skirt. I'd never felt more disheveled or more content.

"Caroline?" Finn's voice was serious again. "That thing you said about mattering to you. Did you mean it?"

My heart hammered. "Yes."

"Even though your mother forbade you from talking to me? Even though I'm not part of your plan?"

"Especially because of those things. Because you're the only person who asks what I want instead of telling me what I should want. Because you see me as Caroline, not as someone's daughter or some project to be managed."

Finn looked like he wanted to say something more, but before he could, Walt appeared.

"Well done, you two! That machine's working perfect." He clapped Finn on the shoulder. "You've got a gift, son. And Caroline, nice work assisting. Maybe you should consider a career in mechanical engineering instead of secretarial work."

He walked away chuckling at his own joke, but his words hung in the air.

"Could you?" Finn asked. "Consider something different? Instead of secretarial school?"

"I don't know. Maybe. If I was brave enough to figure out what I actually wanted and fight for it."

"What do you actually want?"

There was that question again. But this time, with Finn looking at me like my answer actually mattered, with my hands still greasy from helping him fix something, with the memory of his words—"you matter to me too"—still warm in my chest, I was closer to knowing.

"I want to not feel trapped," I said slowly. "I want to make my own choices. I want conversations that matter and work that means something and time with people who see me for who I actually am."

"That sounds like you want freedom."

"Maybe. Or maybe I just want to figure out who I am when I'm not trying to be who everyone else expects."

Finn nodded slowly. "Yeah. I understand that."

We stood there in the middle of the busy arcade, surrounded by noise and customers and the mechanical symphony of games being played. But somehow it felt like we were the only two people in the world.

"Thank you," Finn said. "For helping. And for caring about the engineering stuff. Nobody ever wants to hear about that."

"I always want to hear about it. About anything that matters to you."

His expression shifted to something tender and uncertain. "Caroline—"

"There you are!" Ruby's voice cut through the moment. She bounded over, grinning. "Wow, you two look like you've been through a war. What happened?"

"Fixed the claw machine," I said, suddenly aware of how close Finn and I were standing. "It took a while."

"I can see that." Ruby's knowing smile suggested she saw a lot more than just a fixed machine. "Well, I won't keep you. Just wanted to say hi. Carry on with your... mechanical work."

She walked away, but not before giving me a significant look.

Finn cleared his throat. "I should clean up this mess. Get back to work."

"Yeah. Me too."

But neither of us moved immediately. We just stood there, aware that something had shifted again. That we'd moved past friendship into territory neither of us quite knew how to navigate.

Finally Finn picked up his toolbox. "Caroline? If you ever do figure out what you want—really want, not what anyone else wants for you—I hope you go after it. You deserve to be happy."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing beside the newly fixed claw machine with grease on my hands and hope blooming dangerous and bright in my chest.

Because I was starting to realize exactly what I wanted.

I just had to find the courage to reach for it.
