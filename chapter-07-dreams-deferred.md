# Chapter 7: Dreams Deferred

Thursday afternoon found me refilling the prize candy jars when I noticed the book.

Finn was installing a new prize display shelf—Walt had decided the stuffed animals needed better visibility—and his toolbox sat open on the floor beside him. Among the wrenches and screwdrivers and mysterious tools I couldn't name, I spotted something that didn't belong: a thick book with a worn blue cover and gold lettering on the spine.

"Introduction to Structural Engineering," I read aloud before I could stop myself.

Finn's hand stilled on the shelf bracket he'd been adjusting. He glanced down at his toolbox, then at me, his expression closing down. Defensive.

"Sorry," I said quickly. "I didn't mean to snoop. I just saw it and—" I stopped, unsure how to explain my curiosity without making it worse.

"It's from the library." His voice was flat, offering no explanation.

"I didn't know you were interested in engineering."

"Yeah, well." He returned his attention to the bracket, tightening it with more force than necessary. "Lots of things people don't know about me."

The words stung, though I probably deserved them. How many times had I looked past him, dismissed him as just the maintenance boy, assumed I knew everything worth knowing based on his work clothes and his toolbox?

"Could you tell me?" I asked. "About the engineering?"

Finn's hands stilled again. He turned to look at me, really look, trying to figure out if I was mocking him or genuinely interested. I met his eyes, hoping my expression showed I meant it.

"Why do you care?" Not hostile, just genuinely confused.

"Because you asked me what I wanted, and nobody ever asks me that. And I think maybe nobody ever asks you either. So I'm asking." I set down the candy jar I'd been holding. "I'm interested. Really."

The silence stretched between us.

Finally, Finn sat back on his heels. "I want to design structures. Buildings. Bridges. Things that last." His voice changed, losing its guardedness, becoming warmer. "I like understanding how things stand up, how weight distributes, how you can take raw materials and create something that'll outlast you. Something that matters."

"That's beautiful," I said softly.

"It's impossible." The guardedness slammed back down like a door closing. "People like me don't become engineers. We fix what engineers design. That's how it works."

"Why is it impossible?"

"Because engineering school costs money I don't have. Because I barely finished two years of high school before I had to quit and work. Because even if I could afford school, they'd take one look at where I'm from and—" He stopped himself, jaw tight. "It just is. That's reality."

"But you're learning anyway." I gestured at the library book. "You're teaching yourself."

"I'm reading books." He said it dismissively. "That's not the same as being an engineer."

"It's a start though, isn't it?"

Finn pulled the book from his toolbox, handling it carefully despite his rough words. The cover was worn, the pages dog-eared and marked with small pencil notes in the margins. This wasn't his first time reading it. This was a book he'd studied.

"I like understanding how things work," he said quietly, almost to himself. "When I look at that Ferris wheel out there, I don't just see a ride. I see load calculations and stress points and how the whole thing balances perfectly so forty people can sit up in the air safely. When I fix these machines, I'm not just replacing broken parts. I'm understanding the system—why it broke, how to prevent it from breaking again."

He opened the book to a page marked with a piece of folded paper. Diagrams filled the pages—arching bridges, supported beams, mathematical equations I didn't begin to understand. But Finn looked at them the way other people looked at art.

"This is a suspension bridge," he said, pointing to a diagram. "See how the cables distribute the weight? That's the Brooklyn Bridge design. They built it in 1883, and it's still standing. That's what I love about engineering—when you do it right, it lasts. It matters."

I moved closer, looking at the diagrams over his shoulder. "So why bridges? Why not buildings or something else?"

"Bridges connect things. They take two places that couldn't reach each other and make a path between them." Something in his voice made me think he wasn't just talking about physical distance. "They're about possibility. About saying 'this gap can be crossed, this distance can be overcome.' I like that."

"You'd be good at it," I said. "Really good. Anyone who can figure out how all these arcade machines work and keep the whole boardwalk running could definitely learn to design bridges."

Finn looked at me then, his expression complex—grateful and sad and frustrated all at once. "Thanks for saying that. But wanting something and being able to have it are different things."

"Are they? Always?"

"In my experience, yeah." He closed the book carefully, started to put it back in his toolbox, then hesitated. "I've got three younger siblings. My dad hasn't been able to work steady since his accident. Mom does what she can, but it's not enough. Every dollar I make goes to keeping food on the table and the rent paid. That's just how it is."

"But you're saving something," I said. "You work constantly. All those extra jobs you take—you must be saving something."

"Twenty-three dollars." He said it flatly. "In three years of working every hour I can, I've managed to save twenty-three dollars. You know how much night classes at the community college cost? Fifty dollars per semester, and that's just tuition. Doesn't count books or materials or anything else."

The number hit me like cold water. Three years. Twenty-three dollars. While I'd been saving for secretarial school that Mother would have paid for anyway if I'd asked, Finn had been scraping together coins toward a dream that seemed impossibly far away.

"So what do you do?" I asked. "Just give up?"

"No." The word came out hard, almost angry. "I read library books. I learn what I can. I pay attention to how structures work, how buildings stand, how systems fit together. Maybe I'll never design a bridge, but at least I'll understand them. At least I'll know. That has to be enough."

"Does it?" I thought about my conversation with him earlier in the week, about living someone else's life. "Is understanding someone else's designs enough? Or do you want to create your own?"

Finn stared at me. "You think this is a choice? You think I'm choosing to work maintenance instead of going to engineering school?"

"No. But I think you're choosing to keep learning even when it seems impossible. And that's something." I picked up the library book, felt its weight. "My mother has my whole life planned. Secretary school. Respectable job. Appropriate marriage. It's all mapped out, and it's not even what I want. But you—you know exactly what you want, and you're working toward it even though everything is stacked against you. That's braver than anything I've done."

"It's not brave. It's just stubborn." But something had softened in his expression.

"Maybe that's the same thing."

Finn took the book back, tucking it into his toolbox. "You really want to know what I'd design?"

"Yes."

He pointed toward the boardwalk. "See that pier extending over the water?"

I nodded.

"It's rotting. Give it another five years and the whole thing will be unsafe. They'll either have to rebuild it or tear it down. If I could design something, it'd be that. A pier that could handle storms and salt water and time. A place people could walk out over the ocean and feel safe, feel connected to something bigger than themselves." His voice had that alive quality again, full of passion and vision. "I'd use treated timber and reinforced pilings. I'd calculate for hurricane winds and high tides. I'd make it beautiful but also functional. Something that would last a hundred years."

I could see it. Not the technical details he was describing, but the why behind it. The desire to create something meaningful. To leave a mark on the world that would outlast him. To matter.

"That's beautiful," I said again.

"It's a daydream," he countered. But he was smiling slightly, just a little, like he'd let himself imagine it for a moment and couldn't quite stop.

"Maybe daydreams matter. Maybe they're what keep you working toward something, even when it seems impossible."

"Or maybe they just make it hurt more when reality keeps reminding you what you can't have." Finn stood, brushing sawdust off his pants. "I should finish this shelf."

"Finn—" I stopped, not sure what I wanted to say. That I was sorry? That life was unfair? That he deserved better than what circumstances had given him?

He waited, his dark eyes serious on mine.

"I hope you get your bridge someday," I said finally. "I really do."

Something flickered in his expression. Not quite hope, but maybe the memory of hope. The acknowledgment that someone else believed it was possible, even if he'd stopped believing it himself.

"Thanks, Caroline."

He returned to installing the shelf, and I went back to filling candy jars. But the conversation stayed with me, heavy and complicated. Finn had dreams—real ones, specific ones, passionate ones. But he also had responsibilities and limitations and a reality that made those dreams seem impossibly distant.

While I had opportunity and support and a mother willing to pay for my education. I just didn't have the freedom to choose what that education would be.

Later that evening, driving home with Mother chattering about church meetings, I thought about that library book hidden in Finn's toolbox. How many times had he studied those diagrams, memorizing principles he might never apply?

Finn knew what he wanted but couldn't have it. I could have an education but couldn't choose what I wanted. Both trapped, just in different ways.

The difference was, Finn was learning what he loved. I was learning what was practical.

Somehow his choices felt more honest than mine.

That night, I took the Miss Porter's brochure off my desk and put it in my drawer. Out of sight. Then I lay in bed thinking about bridges and the way Finn's face had changed when he talked about designing structures that would last.

The way people looked when they talked about what they actually wanted.

Maybe wanting something and being able to have it were different things. But at least wanting something real was honest.

At least it was yours.
